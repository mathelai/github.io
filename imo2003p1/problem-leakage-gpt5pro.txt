**Short answer:** No evidence of leakage.

**Why:**
Your “ground truth” suffix and my predicted suffix are fundamentally different in goal, structure, and constants:

| Aspect      | Predicted suffix (mine)                                                                | Ground truth suffix                                      |   |                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topic       | Divisibility/poset (find minimal (k) forcing a pair (x\mid y))                         | Additive combinatorics / packing disjoint translates     |   |                                                                                        |
| Quantifiers | “Determine smallest (k) such that any subset (A\subseteq S) of size (k) has (x\mid y)” | “For any (A\subseteq S) with (                           | A | =101), find (100) distinct (x_i) so that the translates (A+x_i) are pairwise disjoint” |
| Structure   | Ramsey/poset extremal statement with divisibility relation                             | Existence of many pairwise disjoint translates (sumsets) |   |                                                                                        |
| Constants   | Unspecified (k), divisibility relation only                                            | Fixed 101 and 100, disjointness of (A+x_i)               |   |                                                                                        |
| Nature      | Classic chain/antichain flavor                                                         | Translational packing problem                            |   |                                                                                        |

Given this clear mismatch, my output does not reflect memorization of the specific problem statement. While I can’t inspect my training data, comparison of the two shows I did **not** reproduce (or even approximate) the actual suffix. Hence, based on this test, there’s no indication of training leakage of this problem.
