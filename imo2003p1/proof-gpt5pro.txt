**Solution.**
Let
[
S={(h,k)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^2:; h+k<n}.
]
Assume the coloring condition:

> If ((h,k)) is red and (h'\le h,\ k'\le k), then ((h',k')) is also red.

Equivalently, the set of red points is *downward closed* (an order ideal in the product order), hence the set of blue points is *upward closed*.

### Step 1: Reduce the problem to a product over columns/rows

For (h=0,1,\dots,n-1), let
[
c_h=#{k:\ 0\le k\le n-1-h,\ (h,k)\text{ is blue}}
]
be the number of blue points in column (h).
For (k=0,1,\dots,n-1), let
[
r_k=#{h:\ 0\le h\le n-1-k,\ (h,k)\text{ is blue}}
]
be the number of blue points in row (k).

Because red is downward closed, in every fixed column (h) the blue points (if any) form a contiguous top segment; likewise, in every fixed row (k) the blue points form a contiguous right segment. Therefore:

* A **type 1** subset consists of choosing one blue point in each column (h=0,1,\dots,n-1), independently. Hence the number of type 1 subsets is
  [
  N_1=\prod_{h=0}^{n-1} c_h.
  ]

* A **type 2** subset consists of choosing one blue point in each row (k=0,1,\dots,n-1), independently. Hence the number of type 2 subsets is
  [
  N_2=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} r_k.
  ]

It remains to prove (\prod_h c_h=\prod_k r_k).

### Step 2: A key equality via diagonals

For (t=0,1,\dots,n-1), let the **diagonal**
[
\Delta_t={(h,k)\in S:\ h+k=t}.
]
Fix (j\in{1,2,\dots,n}). Consider the set of columns that contain at least (j) blue points.

Because the blue points in a column form a contiguous top segment, a column (h) has at least (j) blue points **iff** the (j)-th point from the top of column (h) is blue. The (j)-th from the top in column (h) has coordinates ((h,,n-h-j)) (provided this lies in (S), i.e. (h\le n-j)). Thus:

[
#{\text{columns with }\ge j\text{ blue}}
=#{,h:\ 0\le h\le n-j,\ (h,,n-h-j)\text{ is blue},}
= #\bigl(\Delta_{n-j}\cap\text{blue}\bigr).
\tag{1}
]

By the same reasoning in rows: a row (k) has at least (j) blue points **iff** the (j)-th point from the right, ((n-k-j,,k)), is blue; hence

[
#{\text{rows with }\ge j\text{ blue}}
=#{,k:\ 0\le k\le n-j,\ (n-k-j,,k)\text{ is blue},}
= #\bigl(\Delta_{n-j}\cap\text{blue}\bigr).
\tag{2}
]

Comparing (1) and (2), we conclude that for every (j),
[
#{\text{columns with }\ge j\text{ blue}}
=#{\text{rows with }\ge j\text{ blue}}.
\tag{3}
]

---

### Step 3: Equality of multisets ({c_h}) and ({r_k})

Given any finite multiset of nonnegative integers (x_1,\dots,x_n), the numbers
[
F(j)=#{i:\ x_i\ge j}\quad (j\ge 1)
]
determine the multiset: indeed, the multiplicity of the value (m) equals (F(m)-F(m+1)).

Apply this with (x_i=c_i) (columns) and with (x_i=r_i) (rows). By (3), the “distribution functions” of ({c_h}) and ({r_k}) coincide for every (j), hence the two multisets ({c_h}) and ({r_k}) are identical. In particular,
[
\prod_{h=0}^{n-1} c_h=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} r_k.
]

Therefore (N_1=N_2): the number of type (1) subsets equals the number of type (2) subsets.

(\square)
