**Problem.** Let (S={1,2,\dots,10^6}). Show that for any (A\subset S) with (|A|=101), there exist (100) distinct (x_1,\dots,x_{100}\in S) such that the sets
[
A+x_i={a+x_i:\ a\in A}\qquad (i=1,\dots,100)
]
are pairwise disjoint.

### Key idea

Two translates (A+x) and (A+y) intersect iff (y-x) is a difference of two elements of (A). So it suffices to choose (x_1,\dots,x_{100}) so that all differences (x_j-x_i) avoid the difference set of (A).

Formally, define the **difference set**
[
D:={a-b:\ a,b\in A}.
]
Note that (0\in D), and the number of *distinct nonzero* differences is at most
[
|{a-b:\ a,b\in A,\ a\neq b}|\ \le\ 2\binom{101}{2} = 10{,}100,
]
since there are at most (\binom{101}{2}=5050) distinct positive differences and the negative ones mirror them. Hence
[
|D|\le 10{,}100+1=10{,}101.
]

We use this to greedily choose the shifts (x_i).

### Greedy construction

We will choose (x_1,\dots,x_{100}\in S) inductively so that for every (i<j),
[
x_j-x_i\notin D.
]
This ensures the translates are disjoint: indeed, if ((A+x_i)\cap(A+x_j)\neq\varnothing), then there exist (a,a'\in A) with (a+x_i=a'+x_j), i.e. (x_j-x_i=a-a'\in D), a contradiction.

Assume we have already chosen distinct (x_1,\dots,x_{t-1}\in S) with the property above (for (t=1) this is vacuous). Consider the **forbidden set**
[
F_{t-1}:=\bigcup_{j=1}^{t-1} (x_j + D)\subset \mathbb{Z}.
]
For any (x\in S), if (x\in F_{t-1}), then (x-x_j\in D) for some (j<t), which we must avoid. Thus any valid (x_t) must lie in (S\setminus F_{t-1}).

Now estimate the size:
[
|(x_j+D)\cap S|\le |D|\le 10{,}101,\qquad \text{for each }j,
]
so by the union bound
[
|F_{t-1}\cap S|\ \le\ \sum_{j=1}^{t-1} |(x_j+D)\cap S|\ \le\ (t-1)\cdot 10{,}101.
]
Therefore, for (t\le 100),
[
|S\setminus F_{t-1}| \ \ge\ |S| - (t-1)\cdot 10{,}101 \ \ge\ 10^6 - 99\cdot 10{,}101 \ =\ 10^6 - 999{,}999 \ =\ 1.
]
So there exists at least one choice for (x_t\in S\setminus F_{t-1}). This completes the induction up to (t=100).

By construction, the (x_i) are distinct (since (x_i=x_j) would give (x_i\in x_j+D) via (0\in D)), and we have ensured (x_j-x_i\notin D) for (i\ne j), hence ((A+x_i)\cap(A+x_j)=\varnothing) for all (i\ne j).

---

### Conclusion

For any (A\subset S) with (|A|=101), there exist (100) distinct (x_1,\dots,x_{100}\in S) such that the translates (A+x_i) are pairwise disjoint.

*(Remark: The numbers line up sharply: (|D|\le 10{,}101) and (99\cdot 10{,}101=999{,}999=|S|-1), guaranteeing that at the 100th step there is still at least one available choice.)*
