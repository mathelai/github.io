This is a proof of the statement: Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, \dots ,1000000\}$. For any subset $A$ of $S$ with $101$ elements, we can find $100$ distinct elements $x_i$ of $S$, such that the sets $\{a + x_i \mid a \in A\}$ are all pairwise disjoint.

**Proof:**

Let $S = \{1, 2, \dots, 1000000\}$. Let $A$ be an arbitrary subset of $S$ with $|A|=101$. We aim to construct a set $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{100}\} \subset S$ consisting of 100 distinct elements, such that the translated sets $A+x_i = \{a+x_i \mid a \in A\}$ are pairwise disjoint.

**1. Condition for Disjointness**

We first analyze the condition required for the sets to be disjoint. Two sets $A+x_i$ and $A+x_j$ are disjoint if and only if their intersection is empty. If $i \neq j$, the condition $(A+x_i) \cap (A+x_j) = \emptyset$ means that for all $a, b \in A$, $a+x_i \neq b+x_j$.

Rearranging this inequality, we get $x_i - x_j \neq b-a$.

Let $D$ be the set of all differences between elements of $A$:
$D = \{b-a \mid a, b \in A\}$.
The condition for the sets $A+x_i$ to be pairwise disjoint is equivalent to requiring that for all distinct $i, j$, the difference $x_i - x_j$ does not belong to $D$.

**2. Estimating the Size of the Difference Set D**

We estimate the maximum possible size of the set $D$. Since $|A|=101$, there are $101 \times 101$ ordered pairs $(a, b)$, so there are at most $101^2 = 10201$ differences.

We can obtain a tighter bound by considering the structure of $D$. Let $D^+$ be the set of positive differences, $D^+ = \{b-a \mid a, b \in A, b>a\}$. The number of ways to choose two distinct elements $a, b$ from $A$ is $\binom{101}{2}$. Thus,
$|D^+| \le \binom{101}{2} = \frac{101 \times 100}{2} = 5050$.

The set $D$ consists of the positive differences $D^+$, the corresponding negative differences $-D^+ = \{a-b \mid a, b \in A, b>a\}$, and the element 0 (since $a-a=0$).
$D = D^+ \cup (-D^+) \cup \{0\}$.
Since $D^+$ and $-D^+$ are disjoint, the maximum size of $D$ is:
$|D| \le 2|D^+| + 1 \le 2(5050) + 1 = 10101$.

**3. Constructing the Set X using a Greedy Approach**

We will construct the set $X=\{x_1, \dots, x_{100}\}$ sequentially using a greedy algorithm. We will show that at each step, there is at least one available choice in $S$.

Step 1: Choose $x_1 \in S$ arbitrarily (e.g., $x_1=1$).

Step $k$ (for $k=2, \dots, 100$): Suppose we have already chosen $k-1$ distinct elements $X_{k-1} = \{x_1, \dots, x_{k-1}\} \subset S$ such that $x_i-x_j \notin D$ for all distinct $i, j \in \{1, \dots, k-1\}$.

We want to choose $x_k \in S$ such that the condition remains satisfied for the set $X_k = X_{k-1} \cup \{x_k\}$. This requires that for all $i=1, \dots, k-1$, $x_k-x_i \notin D$ and $x_i-x_k \notin D$. Since $D$ is symmetric (if $d \in D$, then $-d \in D$), these two conditions are equivalent. So we require $x_k-x_i \notin D$ for all $i < k$.

We analyze the set of forbidden values for $x_k$. A value $y \in S$ is forbidden if $y-x_i \in D$ for some $i < k$. That is, $y = x_i+d$ for some $i < k$ and $d \in D$.
Let $F_k$ be the set of forbidden values:
$F_k = \{x_i+d \mid i=1, \dots, k-1, d \in D\}$.

We need to show that there is at least one element in $S$ that is not forbidden, i.e., $S \setminus F_k \neq \emptyset$.

We estimate the size of $F_k$. The number of forbidden values is bounded by the number of pairs $(i, d)$:
$|F_k| \le (k-1)|D|$.

Note that since $0 \in D$ (because $A$ is non-empty, we can take $a-a=0$), $x_i+0=x_i$ is in $F_k$ for all $i < k$. Thus, any choice $x_k \in S \setminus F_k$ will automatically be distinct from the previously chosen elements $x_1, \dots, x_{k-1}$.

**4. Ensuring the Construction is Possible**

We must ensure that we can complete the construction up to $k=100$. We check the constraints at the final step, when we choose $x_{100}$. The set of forbidden values is $F_{100}$.
$|F_{100}| \le (100-1)|D| = 99|D|$.

Using the bound $|D| \le 10101$, we have:
$|F_{100}| \le 99 \times 10101$.

We calculate the product:
$99 \times 10101 = (100-1) \times 10101 = 1010100 - 10101 = 999999$.

So, the total number of forbidden values for $x_{100}$ is at most 999999.

We are choosing $x_{100}$ from the set $S$, which has $|S|=1000000$. The number of available choices for $x_{100}$ in $S$ is $|S \setminus F_{100}|$.
We know that $|S \setminus F_{100}| = |S| - |S \cap F_{100}|$. Since $|S \cap F_{100}| \le |F_{100}|$, we have:
$|S \setminus F_{100}| \ge |S| - |F_{100}| \ge 1000000 - 999999 = 1$.

Since there is at least one available choice at the final step (and similarly for all preceding steps, as the number of forbidden values is even smaller), the greedy construction succeeds.

**Conclusion**

We have shown that for any subset $A$ of $S$ with 101 elements, we can construct a set $X \subset S$ of 100 distinct elements $\{x_1, \dots, x_{100}\}$ such that the differences between any two distinct elements of $X$ do not belong to the difference set $D$ of $A$. This guarantees that the sets $\{a + x_i \mid a \in A\}$ are all pairwise disjoint.
