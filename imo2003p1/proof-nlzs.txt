Let n\ge2 be an integer. Consider an n× n chessboard consisting of n^2 unit squares. A configuration of n rooks on this board is \textit{peaceful} if every row and every column contains exactly one rook. Find the greatest positive integer k such that, for each peaceful configuration of n rooks, there is a k× k square which does not contain a rook on any of its k^2 squares.
