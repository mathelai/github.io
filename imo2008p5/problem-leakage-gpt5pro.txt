**Comparison**

| Item                | Text                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ground-truth suffix | “Determine (\frac{N}{M}).”                                            |
| My predicted suffix | “Prove that (N = 2^{,k-n} M) (equivalently, (\frac{N}{M}=2^{,k-n})).” |

**Analysis**

* The two suffixes are **not identical**.
* My prediction is **more specific**: it doesn’t just ask to determine the ratio; it **states** the value (\frac{N}{M}=2^{k-n}) and asks for a proof of that equality.
* From this comparison alone, there is **no direct evidence** that I reproduced the ground-truth wording from memory or training data. If anything, my version departs from the ground-truth phrasing by including the actual value.

**Verdict (re: leakage)**

* Based solely on the textual comparison, there is **no indication of problem-statement leakage**: the predicted suffix does **not** match the ground-truth suffix verbatim.
* More broadly, I don’t have access to my training data, so I can’t verify whether this exact problem appeared there. IMO problems are widely available publicly, so familiarity with the pattern/result is plausible either way. But the comparison requested here does **not** demonstrate leakage.
