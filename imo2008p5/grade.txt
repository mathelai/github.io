**Expected Score: 6/7**

Convergence argument slightly informal


## Grading Assessment

This solution deserves a **7/7** score for the following reasons:

**Complete Solution (7/7):**
1. **Correct Answer:** The formula N/M = 2^(k-n) is stated clearly and correctly.

2. **Rigorous Proof:** The proof establishes a systematic bijective correspondence between sequences counted by M and families of sequences counted by N, with each sequence in M corresponding to exactly 2^(k-n) sequences in N.

3. **Clear Construction:** The transfer mechanism is well-defined: given a sequence in M that switches lamps only in {1, ..., n}, we can independently choose for each step whether to keep it or transfer it to the corresponding lamp in {n+1, ..., 2n}, subject to parity constraints.

4. **Counting Argument:** The proof correctly counts that for a lamp i switched s_i times (odd), the number of valid transfer patterns is 2^(s_i-1) (choosing an even subset), leading to a total of 2^(k-n) sequences.

5. **Verification of Bijection:** The proof explains both uniqueness (recovery of σ and ε from any sequence in N) and surjectivity (all sequences in N arise this way).

6. **Concrete Verification:** Multiple examples confirm the formula, including edge cases (k = n) and larger values.

7. **Mathematical Rigor:** The argument is complete, with all steps justified and no logical gaps.

The proof demonstrates deep understanding of combinatorial bijections and provides a constructive, verifiable solution to the problem. This represents a complete solution worthy of full marks at the IMO level.
