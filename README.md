# MathEL: Autonomous Self-Improving AI for IMO Combinatorics

A collection of problems, proofs, AI-generated proofs, statistics, simmulations, interactive visualizations, for 39 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) combinatorics problems between 2000-2025.

## Overview

MathEL provides an ecosystem for exploring, solving, and learning IMO combinatorics problems:

- **Multiple proof approaches** - Official solutions, AI-generated proofs, and formal Lean 4 proofs
- **Automated grading** - Proof evaluation compared with ground truth solutions
- **Study and lean** - Study and learn problems and correct proofs
- **Python simulations** - Experimental verification and pattern discovery
- **Interactive web visualizations** - Explore problems by dynamic, browser-based simulations
- **No server required** - Works offline in the browser

## Quick Start

### Browse Problems

Open `index.html` in your web browser to:
- Browse all 39 problems with search, filtering, and sorting
- View problem metadata (year, difficulty, category, nicknames)
- Click any problem card to open its proofs and interactive visualization

### View Individual Problems

Each `imo{YYYY}p{N}/index.html` provides:
- Direct links to all proof types and study materials
- Integrated Lean 4 playground launcher
- Interactive problem visualization with controls

### Run Simulations (Optional)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install numpy pydantic

# Run a simulation
cd imo2022p1
python3 simulation.py
```

## Features

### Interactive Problem Browser

The main `index.html` provides:
- **Search** - Find problems by nickname, category, or ID
- **Filters** - By year, category, or difficulty
- **Sorting** - By difficulty (Easy to Hard), year, or problem number
- **Dark/Light theme** toggle
- **Icon-based navigation** - Quick access to all proof types and materials

### Problem Nicknames

Problems have memorable nicknames for easy reference:
- IMO 2022 P1: "The Bank of Oslo"
- IMO 2019 P5: "The Bank of Bath"
- IMO 2013 P6: "Balanced Chords"
- IMO 2022 P6: "Nordic Square"
- And many more...

### Multiple Proof Types

Each problem includes up to 9 different resources:
1. **Study** - Study and learn of problem and correct proof
2. **Answer** - Ground truth answer, not proof
3. **Proof Shortlist** - Official IMO solution(s)
4. **Proof Deep Think** - AI-generated proof (Gemini DeepThink)
5. **Proof GPT 5 Pro** - AI-generated proof (OpenAI GPT-5 Pro)
6. **Sim** - Interactive simulation
7. **Proof Lean** - Formal proof in Lean 4 (opens live.lean-lang.org)
8. **Proof All** - Combined proof
9. **Grade** - Automated grading of AI proofs

### Lean 4 Integration

Problems with formal proofs include:
- `proof.lean` - Lean 4 formalization
- `proof.js` - Generated JavaScript module
- Direct integration with [live.lean-lang.org](https://live.lean-lang.org/)
- One-click loading of proof code with LZ-String compression

### Automated Grading

The `scripts/grade_problems.py` tool uses GPT-5 to:
- Evaluate AI-generated proofs against official solutions
- Assign IMO-style grades (0-7)
- Provide detailed justification comments
- Support both GPT-5 and GPT-5 Pro models

```bash
# Grade all problems (GPT-5 Pro by default)
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'
python3 scripts/grade_problems.py

# Use regular GPT-5 instead
python3 scripts/grade_problems.py -gpt5

# View help
python3 scripts/grade_problems.py --help
```

Results are saved to `grade.txt` in each problem directory.

- Extremal Combinatorics
- Combinatorial Number Theory

### By Difficulty
Problems appear by IMO score means:
- Easy (≤2.5 mean score)
- Medium (2.5-5.0 mean score)
- Hard (>5.0 mean score)

## Results Schema

All `results.json` files conform to `schemas/results.schema.json`:

```json
{
  "problem_id": "IMO-2022-P1",
  "params": { ... },
  "method": "algorithm_name",
  "metrics": { ... },
  "seed": 42,
  "environment": {
    "python_version": "3.12.0",
    "platform": "Darwin-24.6.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Development

### Generate Lean Proof Modules

After modifying `proof.lean` files:

```bash
python3 generate_proof_js.py
```

This creates `proof.js` modules that enable direct loading into Lean 4 Web.

### Update Problem Metrics

```bash
python3 populate_metrics.py
```

## Requirements

### For Visualizations
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- No internet connection required after download

### For Simulations
- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- pydantic

### For Grading
- Python 3.8+
- openai Python package
- OpenAI API key with GPT-5 access
