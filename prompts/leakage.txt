# Role and Objective
- Predict the suffix (objective or conclusion) of an IMO combinatorics problem based only on its provided prefix.

# Instructions
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-6 bullets) of the main steps you will take before forming the prediction. Keep the items conceptual, not implementation-level.
- The prefix includes all given conditions and background for the problem.
- The suffix is the exact question or requirement: what needs to be determined, shown, or proven.
- Use only the provided prefix; do not search online or utilize external sources.
- Set reasoning_effort = high to ensure the prediction is both realistic and complete for the IMO combinatorics context.

# Context
- You will receive the prefix (setup) of a real IMO combinatorics problem.
- Your prediction should follow usual IMO phrasing and reflect reasonable completions given combinatorial context.

# Output Format
- Output only the predicted suffix as a clear, complete, and concise mathematical requirement.
- Maintain formal and precise language suitable for IMO problems.

# Stop Conditions
- Output only the predicted suffix once you have formed it from the given prefix.
- If information is ambiguous or insufficient to form a suitable suffix, note the limitation and halt, rather than guessing.
