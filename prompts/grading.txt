# Objective

Evaluate the **correctness and completeness** of two AI-generated IMO proofs by comparing them against the **set of official solutions** in `proof-shortlist.txt`. Do **not** assess final numeric/symbolic answers.

# Checklist (3–7 steps)

1. Verify all required files are present and non-empty.
2. For each AI (GPT 5 Pro, then DeepThink), identify the **closest-matching official solution** (by structure/lemmas/casework).
3. Assess **correctness** (logical validity, justified steps) and **completeness** (all necessary cases/lemmas/edge conditions) **relative to that official solution**.
4. If the AI mixes approaches, grade against the **official solution that yields the fairest/higher valid score**, provided the hybrid is coherent.
5. Assign an IMO **grade (0–7)** and add a brief justification.
6. Record any file issues as errors and validate JSON schema/order.

# Files

* `problem.txt`: IMO problem
* `proof-shortlist.txt`: Official solutions (may contain multiple proofs)
* `proof-gpt5pro.txt`: GPT 5 Pro’s proof
* `proof-deepthink.txt`: DeepThink’s proof

# Procedure (per AI proof; evaluate GPT 5 Pro first)

1. **Map to Official Solution(s)**

   * Scan `proof-shortlist.txt` for solution “families” (e.g., invariants/graph-theoretic/inequality/constructive).
   * Choose the **best-aligned** official solution as the reference. If ambiguous, evaluate against multiple and keep the **most generous fair** result.

2. **Assess Correctness**

   * Check each claim/lemma against the reference solution’s logic (or a valid alternative).
   * Flag unjustified steps, hidden assumptions, circularity, or non-sequiturs.

3. **Assess Completeness**

   * Confirm all required cases/subcases, boundary conditions, and final deduction are covered to reach the problem’s conclusion.
   * If the AI takes a valid alternative route not in the shortlist, accept it fully if sound; otherwise award partial credit for substantiated progress.

4. **Grade (IMO 0–7)**

   * **7**: Fully correct and complete proof (possibly via any official approach).
   * **5–6**: Essentially correct; at most minor omissions/repairable gaps.
   * **2–4**: Substantial partial progress (key lemmas/cases) but incomplete or with significant gaps.
   * **1**: Small but relevant idea.
   * **0**: No meaningful progress.
   * Prefer the **fairest** grading among plausible mappings; do not penalize for style or for choosing a different valid route.

5. **Comment**

   * One concise sentence explaining the main driver of the score (e.g., “complete except missing extremal-case justification”).

6. **Error Handling**

   * If any required file is missing/empty for a proof, set its `grade` to **null** and describe the issue in `error`.

7. **Validation**

   * Ensure the final JSON matches the schema exactly and preserves key order.
