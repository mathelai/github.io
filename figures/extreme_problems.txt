Figure: "Killer Problems" and Extreme Cases: The Outliers of IMO

This figure identifies and analyzes the most extreme IMO problems, focusing on "killer problems" with exceptionally high failure rates and examining the landscape of difficulty outliers across all problem types.

Panel (A) - Distribution of Failure Rates:
Histogram showing the distribution of failure rates (percentage scoring 0-1 points) across all 156 problems from 2000-2025. The distribution is roughly normal with a mean around 45-50% failure rate, but exhibits a notable right tail extending beyond 80% failure. The green and blue bars representing the highest failure rates (75-100%) identify 30 "killer problems" that defeated more than 80% of contestants. This long tail demonstrates that while most problems are calibrated to challenge roughly half the field, a significant subset is designed to be exceptionally difficult, likely serving as discriminators for medal cutoffs.

Panel (B) - Top 20 Hardest Problems Across All Types:
Horizontal bar chart ranking the 20 most difficult problems by mean score (lower = harder). The hardest problem is 2017 P3 (Combinatorics, μ = 0.042, 99% failure rate), followed by 2016 P3 (Combinatorics, μ = 0.115) and 2007 P6 (Combinatorics, μ = 0.167). Combinatorics (red) dominates the top 20 with 11 problems, followed by Number Theory (orange, 5 problems), Geometry (green, 3 problems), and Algebra (blue, 1 problem). Notably, positions P3 and P6 are heavily represented, confirming these are designated "hard" positions. The mean scores cluster extremely low (μ < 1.0 for most), with several below 0.3, indicating these problems achieved near-universal failure.

Panel (C) - Failure vs Success Landscape:
Scatter plot showing mean score (x-axis) against failure rate (y-axis) for all problems. A clear negative correlation dominates: as mean score increases, failure rate decreases. However, the relationship shows interesting non-linearity. Problems cluster in three regions: (1) killer zone (μ < 1, failure > 75%), (2) moderate zone (μ = 1-4, failure = 30-70%), and (3) accessible zone (μ > 4, failure < 35%). Combinatorics (red) shows the densest concentration in the killer zone, while Geometry (green) and Number Theory (orange) problems spread more evenly across all zones. Several outliers appear: problems with moderate mean scores but exceptionally high failure rates (>70%), suggesting bimodal distributions where a small elite group solved them perfectly while most failed.

Panel (D) - Difficulty vs Variability:
Scatter plot showing mean score against standard deviation in scores. An inverted-U pattern emerges clearly: problems at extreme difficulty levels (very easy or very hard) show low variability (σ < 1.5), while moderate-difficulty problems show maximum variability (σ ≈ 2.5-3.0 at μ = 2-3). This pattern appears across all problem types, indicated by the color distribution. The highest variability occurs for problems with mean scores of 2-3, where score distributions are most spread out. Combinatorics problems (red) cluster toward the low-mean, low-variability region, confirming they tend to produce uniform failure. Geometry problems (green) show some of the highest variability points, suggesting more diverse performance outcomes.

Key Insights for MathEL:
1. Killer problem prevalence: 30 problems (19% of all IMO problems) achieve >80% failure rates, with 2017 P3 representing the ultimate challenge (99% failure, μ = 0.042)
2. Combinatorics dominance in extremes: 11 of the top 20 hardest problems are Combinatorics, representing 55% of extreme challenges despite being only 25% of all problems
3. Position correlation with difficulty: P3 and P6 positions dominate the hardest problems list, indicating systematic difficulty placement by problem committees
4. Bimodal outliers: Several problems combine moderate mean scores with high failure rates, revealing bimodal distributions where a small elite succeeds while most fail completely
5. Moderate problems maximize information: The inverted-U variability pattern confirms that moderate-difficulty problems (μ = 2-3) provide maximum discrimination between ability levels

Implications for MathEL: The system must develop specialized capabilities for "killer" Combinatorics problems that appear in P3/P6 positions, as these represent the frontier of difficulty. MathEL should not expect linear difficulty progression; some problems designed to defeat >80% of human contestants may require fundamentally different approaches. The bimodal patterns suggest MathEL needs robust all-or-nothing solution strategies rather than partial approaches. Training should include explicit exposure to these extreme cases to calibrate the system's difficulty assessment and resource allocation. Understanding that moderate-difficulty problems offer maximum learning signal, MathEL should prioritize these for general skill development while treating killer problems as specialized challenges requiring dedicated strategies.

Statistics Summary: Across 2000-2025, the hardest problem was 2017 P3 (Combinatorics) with μ = 0.042 and 99% failure rate. 30 "killer problems" achieved >80% failure rates, with Combinatorics representing 11 of the top 20 hardest problems overall.
