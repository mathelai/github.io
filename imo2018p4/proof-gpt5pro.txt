**Chessboard coloring.** Color the (20\times 20) grid in the usual black–white way, so that ((x,y)) is black iff (x+y) is even. A distance (\sqrt5) between two lattice points means the coordinate difference is ((\pm1,\pm2)) or ((\pm2,\pm1)), i.e. a knight’s move. Such a move always changes color, so **no two sites of the same color are at distance (\sqrt5)**.

There are (200) black and (200) white sites.

---

### Lower bound: Amy can ensure (100).

Amy adopts the strategy: **always place on black sites**. Because no two black sites are at distance (\sqrt5), this is always legal as long as there is an unoccupied black site.

Ben can occupy at most one black site per turn, and Amy moves first. Among the (200) black sites, on each pair of moves (Amy+Ben) at most two black sites are consumed. Hence Amy secures at least half of the black sites, i.e.
[
\text{Amy places at least } \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ red stones.}
]

---

### Upper bound: Ben can hold Amy to at most (100).

Ben uses the **copy-color strategy**:

> After Amy places a red stone on some color (c\in{\text{black},\text{white}}), Ben places a blue stone on any unoccupied site of the same color (c) (if any such site remains). If that color is already full, he plays anywhere (this choice won’t matter).

Let (R_c) and (B_c) be the numbers of red and blue stones on color (c).

**Claim (invariant).** After each of Ben’s moves we have
[
B_{\text{black}} \ge R_{\text{black}}\quad\text{and}\quad B_{\text{white}} \ge R_{\text{white}}.
]
*Proof.* Initially, it holds trivially. Suppose it holds after some Ben move. Amy plays on color (c), increasing (R_c) by (1).

* If there is an unoccupied site of color (c), Ben also plays on color (c), increasing (B_c) by (1), restoring (B_c\ge R_c).
* If color (c) has no unoccupied site after Amy’s move, then before her move exactly one such site remained, so (R_c+B_c=99) before, and by the inductive hypothesis (B_c\ge R_c), which forces (B_c\ge 50) and (R_c\le 49). After Amy’s move, (R_c) becomes at most (50) and (B_c\ge 50); hence (B_c\ge R_c) still holds. The other color is unchanged, so its inequality persists. (\square)

At the end of the game, in each color (c) there are at most (100) occupied sites, so
[
R_c + B_c \le 100\quad\text{and}\quad B_c \ge R_c ;\Rightarrow; 2R_c \le 100 ;\Rightarrow; R_c \le 50.
]
Summing over both colors gives
[
R_{\text{black}} + R_{\text{white}} \le 50 + 50 = 100.
]
Thus Ben can always keep Amy to at most (100) red stones.

*(Note: The game necessarily ends on Amy’s turn—Ben can always move unless the board is full—but the argument above does not rely on who moves last.)*

---

Combining the lower and upper bounds, the greatest (k) that Amy can guarantee is
[
\boxed{100}.
