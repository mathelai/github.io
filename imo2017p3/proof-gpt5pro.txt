**Answer: No.**
There is a strategy for the rabbit (together with the tracker) that defeats *every* possible strategy of the hunter and forces the distance to exceed (100) after (10^9) rounds.

---

## Notation

At the beginning of round (n),

* the rabbit is at (A_{n-1}), the hunter at (B_{n-1});
* after the rabbit moves, it is at (A_n);
* the tracker reports (P_n) with (\lvert P_n - A_n\rvert \le 1);
* the hunter then moves to (B_n) with (\lvert B_n - B_{n-1}\rvert=1).

Let
[
d_{n} ;=; \lvert A_n - B_n\rvert,\qquad r ;=; \lvert A_n - B_{n-1}\rvert.
]

---

## The adversarial strategy

Fix some round (n), and suppose (d_{n-1}=\lvert A_{n-1}-B_{n-1}\rvert = d).

1. **Rabbit’s move.** The rabbit moves directly *away* from (B_{n-1}), so that
   [
   r=\lvert A_n - B_{n-1}\rvert = d+1.
   ]

2. **Tracker’s report.** Consider the two intersection points (S_+), (S_-) of the circles
   [
   {X:\lvert X-A_n\rvert=1}\quad\text{and}\quad {X:\lvert X-B_{n-1}\rvert=r}.
   ]
   These form an isosceles triangle (B_{n-1}A_nS_{\pm}) with equal sides (r,r) and base (1). Let (e) be the unit vector from (B_{n-1}) to (A_n), and let (\theta) be the angle between the rays (B_{n-1}A_n) and (B_{n-1}S_\pm). By the law of cosines,
   [
   \cos\theta ;=; \frac{r^2+r^2-1}{2r^2} ;=; 1-\frac{1}{2r^2}.
   ]
   The tracker chooses **whichever** of (S_\pm) will be worse for the hunter’s particular strategy (defined below), i.e. whichever yields the larger final distance after the hunter’s response.

   (The tracker can do this because it knows the hunter’s strategy as a function of the report.)

3. **Hunter’s move.** The hunter, upon seeing the chosen (P_n=S\in{S_+,S_-}), makes some move
   [
   B_n ;=; B_{n-1} + u,\qquad \lvert u\rvert=1,
   ]
   determined by her (arbitrary) strategy.

We now prove that *no matter how* the hunter chooses (u), this adversarial choice of (A_n) and (P_n) forces a quantitative lower bound for the new distance (d_n).

## A one–round lower bound that holds against every hunter move

Write (H=B_{n-1}), (R=A_n), and let (S\in{S_+,S_-}) be the tracker’s choice. Set
[
\widehat s ;=; \frac{S-H}{\lvert S-H\rvert},\qquad e ;=; \frac{R-H}{\lvert R-H\rvert}=\frac{R-H}{r}.
]
For the two candidates (S_\pm), we have
[
\widehat s_\pm ;=; \cos\theta, e ;\pm; \sin\theta, e_\perp,
]
so
[
\frac{\widehat s_+ + \widehat s_-}{2} ;=; \cos\theta, e.
]
Let (u) be the hunter’s unit step. Then among the two choices (S_\pm) we certainly have
[
\min{;u!\cdot!\widehat s_+,,, u!\cdot!\widehat s_-;}
;\le; \frac{u!\cdot!(\widehat s_+ + \widehat s_-)}{2}
;=; \cos\theta,(u!\cdot!e)
;\le; \cos\theta.
]
Hence the tracker can choose (S\in{S_+,S_-}) so that
[
u!\cdot!\widehat s ;\le; \cos\theta. \tag{1}
]

Now write
[
R-B_n ;=; (R-S) ;+; (S-H) ;-; (B_n-H)
;=; w ;+; r\widehat s ;-; u,
]
with (\lvert w\rvert=1) and (by isosceles geometry) (w!\cdot!\widehat s=\cos\angle RS H = \dfrac{1}{2r}).

Compute:
[
\begin{aligned}
\lvert R-B_n\rvert^2
&= \lvert w\rvert^2 + r^2 + \lvert u\rvert^2 + 2r,w!\cdot!\widehat s ;-; 2,w!\cdot!u ;-; 2r,\widehat s!\cdot!u\
&= r^2 + 2 ;-; 2,w!\cdot!u ;-; 2r,\widehat s!\cdot!u ;+; 2r\cdot\frac{1}{2r}\
&= r^2 + 1 ;-; 2,w!\cdot!u ;-; 2r,\widehat s!\cdot!u.
\end{aligned}
]
Since (\lvert w!\cdot!u\rvert\le 1), we get
[
\lvert R-B_n\rvert^2 ;\ge; r^2 - 1 ;-; 2r,\widehat s!\cdot!u
;\ge; r^2 - 1 ;-; 2r,\cos\theta \quad\text{by },(1).
]
Therefore
[
d_n^2 = \lvert A_n - B_n\rvert^2;\ge; r^2 - 1 - 2r\cos\theta
= r^2 - 1 - 2r!\left(1-\frac{1}{2r^2}\right)
= (r-1)^2 + \frac{1}{r}.
]
Recalling (r=d+1), we have the **universal one–round inequality**
[
\boxed{;d_n^2 ;\ge; d_{n-1}^2 ;+; \frac{1}{d_{n-1}+1};}\tag{(*)}
]
which holds **for every hunter strategy** against the described adversarial choice of the rabbit and the tracker.

## Growth of a potential and the final bound

From ((*)) with (d_0=0) we get (d_1^2\ge 1), so (d_1\ge 1). For (d\ge 1) set (t=\dfrac{1}{d+1}). Then
[
d_n^2 ;\ge; d^2 + t,\qquad
d_n ;\ge; \sqrt{d^2+t} ;\ge; d + \frac{t}{2d}
]
(using (\sqrt{a+t}\ge \sqrt a + \tfrac{t}{2\sqrt a}) for (a,t>0)).

Thus for (d\ge 1),
[
\begin{aligned}
d_n^3 - d^3
&= (d_n-d),(d_n^2 + d_n d + d^2)
= \frac{d_n^2 - d^2}{d_n + d},(d_n^2 + d_n d + d^2)\
&\ge \frac{t}{2d},\cdot, 3d^2 ;=; \frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{d}{d+1} ;\ge; \frac{3}{4}.
\end{aligned}
]
(We used (d_n\ge d) and (t=\frac{1}{d+1}).)

Therefore, for all (N\ge 1),
[
d_N^3 ;\ge; d_1^3 + \sum_{n=2}^{N} \frac{3}{4}
;\ge; 1 + \frac{3}{4}(N-1) ;\ge; \frac{3}{4}N.
]
In particular, for (N=10^9),
[
d_{10^9} ;\ge; \biggl(\frac{3}{4}\cdot 10^9\biggr)^{!1/3} ;>; 900 ;>; 100.
]

## Conclusion

Even if the hunter employs *any* strategy (possibly using the full history), the rabbit and the tracker can coordinate as above to force the distance after (10^9) rounds to exceed (100). Hence it is **not** always possible for the hunter to guarantee being within (100) of the rabbit after (10^9) rounds.
