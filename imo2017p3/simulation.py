IMO 2017 Problem 3: Hunter and Rabbit Game Simulation

This simulation implements the hunter-rabbit pursuit game to explore strategies
and generate ground truth data for proving whether the hunter can guarantee
being within distance 100 of the rabbit after 10^9 rounds.

Key insights:
- Rabbit moves exactly distance 1 each round
- Tracking device reports point within distance 1 of rabbit
- Hunter moves exactly distance 1 each round
- Both start at the same point (0, 0)
