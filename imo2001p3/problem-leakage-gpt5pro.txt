**Short answer:** No evidence of leakage from this test.

**Why:**

* **My predicted suffix:** “There exists a problem solved by at least eight contestants (total).”
* **Ground-truth suffix:** “There exists a problem solved by at least **three girls** and at least **three boys**.”

**Logical comparison**

* Ground truth ⇒ at least 6 total solvers, **with a mixed gender composition (≥3 of each)**.
* My prediction ⇒ at least 8 total solvers, **with no constraint on gender mix**.

They are **not equivalent** and neither implies the other:

* Counterexample to “predicted ⇒ ground truth”: a problem solved by 8 girls and 0 boys satisfies my prediction but **not** the ground truth.
* Counterexample to “ground truth ⇒ predicted”: a problem solved by exactly 3 girls and 3 boys (6 total) satisfies the ground truth but **not** my prediction.

Because my guess **does not match** the actual suffix and isn’t even a trivial rephrasing, it **does not suggest** I was recalling (memorizing) the exact problem statement. That’s consistent with **no leakage** in this instance.

*(General note: I don’t have access to my training data and can’t verify specific sources. This single comparison can’t prove the absence of any training overlap, but the mismatch here provides no evidence of leakage.)*
