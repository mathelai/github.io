"comment": "Matches Shortlist Solution 1: partitions problems by |G(p)| ≤ 2 vs ≥ 3 (thus |B(p)| ≤ 2 in the latter), shows each boy has a P2 and each girl a P1 problem, then double-counts M=∑|G(p)||B(p)| to get 441 ≤ 2(N_{B,1}+N_{G,2}) while N_{B,1}+N_{G,2} ≤ 210, a clean contradiction; fully correct and complete.
