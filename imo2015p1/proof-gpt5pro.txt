Below is a complete solution. We use only elementary geometry and a simple double–counting argument.

## Definitions and a basic observation

For distinct points (A,B,C) in the plane,
[
AC=BC \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad C\ \text{lies on the perpendicular bisector of }AB.
]
Thus a finite set (\mathcal S) is **balanced** iff for every unordered pair ({A,B}\subset\mathcal S) the perpendicular bisector of (AB) contains at least one point of (\mathcal S).

A set (\mathcal S) is **centre-free** iff no point of (\mathcal S) is equidistant from three (distinct) points of (\mathcal S). Equivalently, for any fixed (P\in\mathcal S), the multiset of distances ({PQ:Q\in\mathcal S\setminus{P}}) has no value occurring three or more times; each distance can occur at most twice.

## Part I — For every (n\ge 3) there exists a balanced set of (n) points

Fix a point (O) and a circle (\omega) of radius (r) centered at (O).
Let (m=n-1). Write
[
m=2a+3b\qquad(a,b\in\mathbb Z_{\ge0}),
]
which is always possible for (m\ge 2) (take (b=0) if (m) is even; take (b=1) and (a=(m-3)/2) if (m) is odd).

On (\omega), choose:

* (a) disjoint pairs ((U_i,V_i)) with (\angle U_iOV_i=60^\circ);
* (b) disjoint triples ((X_j,Y_j,Z_j)) with (\angle X_jOY_j=\angle Y_jOZ_j=60^\circ)
  (i.e. three consecutive vertices of a regular hexagon).

Let
[
\mathcal S={O}\ \cup\ {U_i,V_i:1\le i\le a}\ \cup\ {X_j,Y_j,Z_j:1\le j\le b}.
]
Then (|\mathcal S|=1+2a+3b = n).

**Claim.** (\mathcal S) is balanced.

* If (A,B\in\omega), then (OA=OB=r), so (O) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (AB) and witnesses (AC=BC).
* If the pair is ({O,U_i}), choose (C=V_i). Since (\angle U_iOV_i=60^\circ), by the law of cosines
  [
  U_iV_i^2=OU_i^2+OV_i^2-2\cdot OU_i\cdot OV_i\cos 60^\circ
  =r^2+r^2-2r^2\cdot\frac12=r^2,
  ]
  hence (OU_i=OV_i=U_iV_i=r), so (V_i) is equidistant to (O) and (U_i).
* Similarly, if the pair is ({O,Y_j}), take (C=X_j) (or (Z_j)); again (\angle X_jOY_j=60^\circ) so (OX_j=Y_jX_j=r).

Thus every unordered pair from (\mathcal S) has a witness in (\mathcal S), and (\mathcal S) is balanced.
(For (n\ge4) this construction is not centre‑free because (O) is equidistant from any three chosen points on (\omega).)

Hence **for all (n\ge3) a balanced set of size (n) exists**.

## Part II — Balanced and centre‑free sets: determination of all sizes

We prove:

> **Theorem.** There exists a balanced centre‑free set of (n) points **iff (n) is odd**.

We split this into existence for odd (n) and impossibility for even (n).

### 1) Existence for odd (n)

Let (n\ge3) be odd. Take (\mathcal S) to be the vertex set of a regular (n)-gon (V_0,V_1,\dots,V_{n-1}) inscribed in a circle with center (O).

* **Balanced.** For any (a,b\in{0,\dots,n-1}), let (j) be the unique residue mod (n) with
  [
  2j\equiv a+b\pmod n.
  ]
  (Uniqueness/existence holds because (2) is invertible mod (n) when (n) is odd.)
  Then the central angles satisfy (\angle V_aOV_j=\angle V_bOV_j), so the chords (V_aV_j) and (V_bV_j) have equal length, i.e. (V_j) is equidistant from (V_a) and (V_b). Thus (\mathcal S) is balanced.

* **Centre‑free.** Fix (P=V_0). For each (k=1,\dots,\frac{n-1}{2}), the two vertices (V_k) and (V_{n-k}) are symmetric about the line (OV_0) and hence are at the same distance from (V_0). Since (n) is odd, there is **no** opposite vertex at distance occurring once; every distance from (V_0) occurs exactly twice. Therefore there are never three distinct vertices at the same distance from (V_0). The same holds for any choice of (P\in\mathcal S). Hence (\mathcal S) is centre‑free.

Thus for every odd (n\ge3) there exists a balanced centre‑free set of (n) points (e.g. a regular (n)-gon).

### 2) Impossibility for even (n)

Assume (\mathcal S) is balanced and centre‑free with (|\mathcal S|=n).

For each (P\in\mathcal S), partition (\mathcal S\setminus{P}) by equal distances from (P).
Since (\mathcal S) is centre‑free, each distance class has size at most (2). Let (m(P)) be the number of size‑(2) classes (i.e. the number of unordered pairs ({A,B}\subset\mathcal S\setminus{P}) with (PA=PB)).

* **Upper bound.** For each (P),
  [
  n-1=\sum_{\text{classes}}(\text{class size})\le 2,m(P)+1\cdot\bigl((\text{# of classes})-m(P)\bigr),
  ]
  which immediately yields (m(P)\le \left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor). Summing over (P),
  [
  \sum_{P\in\mathcal S} m(P)\ \le\ n\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor.
  ]

* **Lower bound (by balancedness).** Let (T) be the set of all pairs ((P,{A,B})) with (P,A,B\in\mathcal S) distinct and (PA=PB). Then
  [
  |T|=\sum_{P\in\mathcal S} m(P).
  ]
  Balancedness says: for every unordered pair ({A,B}\subset\mathcal S) there exists at least one (P\in\mathcal S) with (PA=PB). Hence
  [
  |T|\ \ge\ \binom{n}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
  ]

Combining,
[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\ \le\ \sum_{P} m(P)\ \le\ n\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor.
]
If (n) is even, then (\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor=\frac{n-2}{2}), so the right-hand side equals (\frac{n(n-2)}{2}), strictly less than (\frac{n(n-1)}{2}). Contradiction.

Therefore, **no balanced centre‑free set of even size exists**.

---

## Conclusion

* For **every** (n\ge3) there is a balanced set of (n) points (explicit construction above).
* A balanced **centre‑free** set of size (n) exists **iff (n) is odd** (take a regular (n)-gon when (n) is odd; and even (n) is impossible by the double–counting argument).

So your proposed answer for the second part — **“all odd integers (\ge 3)”** — is correct.
