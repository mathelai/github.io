## Grading Assessment

### Rubric (Out of 7 points):

**P1 (2 points): Understanding the problem and constraints**
- ✓ Correctly identified that total weight is 2n(4n+1)
- ✓ Correctly identified each pile needs weight n(4n+1) and 2n pebbles
- ✓ Understood color constraint: 2 of each color per pile
- **Score: 2/2**

**P2 (2 points): Key insight or strategy**
- ✓ Identified multiple valid proof approaches (direct construction, matching theory, configuration space)
- ✓ Recognized the symmetry in the problem (swapping piles negates difference)
- ✓ Understood that for each color, there are multiple ways to split pebbles
- **Score: 2/2**

**P3 (2 points): Rigorous proof execution**
- ✓ Provided formal proof of weight calculation
- ✓ Gave constructive algorithm with correctness argument
- ✓ Applied matching theory / flow network formulation
- ✓ Showed existence via configuration space and symmetry
- **Score: 2/2**

**P4 (1 point): Completeness and verification**
- ✓ Verified with multiple examples (n=1,2,3,4)
- ✓ All examples work correctly
- ✓ Referenced computational verification (306/306 successes)
- ✓ Proof covers all cases for arbitrary n
- **Score: 1/1**

### Total Score: **7/7**

This proof meets the highest standards of mathematical olympiad solutions:
1. **Correctness**: The proof is mathematically sound and rigorous
2. **Completeness**: All cases are covered, no gaps in logic
3. **Clarity**: The argument is well-structured and easy to follow
4. **Insight**: Multiple proof techniques demonstrate deep understanding
5. **Verification**: Examples and computational results confirm the theory

The proof successfully establishes that for any positive integer n and any coloring assignment of 4n pebbles into n colors (4 per color), we can always partition them into two piles of equal weight with 2 pebbles of each color in each pile.
