**Problem suffix (prediction):**

> Determine the largest possible number of blue elements in (S) under the given coloring rule if (S) contains neither a type (1) subset nor a type (2) subset. Prove that this maximum equals (\binom{n}{2}).
>
> Equivalently, prove that if at least (\binom{n}{2}+1) elements of (S) are blue, then (S) necessarily contains either a type (1) subset (i.e., (n) blue elements with pairwise distinct first coordinates) or a type (2) subset (i.e., (n) blue elements with pairwise distinct second coordinates).
>
> Show that this bound is sharp by giving an example of a coloring with exactly (\binom{n}{2}) blue elements and with neither a type (1) nor a type (2) subset (for instance, color all points with (h=0) red and all remaining points blue).
