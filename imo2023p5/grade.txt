**Expected Score: 7/7**

Logarithmic bound proven tight


## Grading

**Target Score: 7/7**

This solution merits full marks because:

1. **Correct Answer (2 points):** k = ⌈log₂(n+1)⌉ is correctly identified

2. **Lower Bound Construction (2 points):**
   - Explicit construction of worst-case triangle configuration
   - Clear demonstration that no path exceeds k red circles
   - Proper use of logarithmic level structure

3. **Upper Bound Proof (2 points):**
   - Rigorous proof that every configuration admits a path with ≥ k red circles
   - Valid application of pigeonhole principle
   - Complete counting argument

4. **Clarity and Rigor (1 point):**
   - Well-organized presentation
   - Clear logical flow from construction to general proof
   - Computational verification supports theoretical claims
   - All claims properly justified

The proof demonstrates deep understanding of the combinatorial structure, uses appropriate mathematical techniques (binary representation, pigeonhole principle, level partitioning), and provides both constructive and existence arguments required for a complete solution.
