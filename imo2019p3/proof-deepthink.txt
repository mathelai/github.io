This is a proof of the statement.

**1. Understanding the Setup and Invariants**

Let the social network be represented by a graph $G=(V, E)$ with $|V|=2019$ users. The allowed operation is: Given users A, B, C such that A is friends with B and C, but B and C are not friends, the friendships change by removing (A, B) and (A, C), and adding (B, C).

We analyze the effect of this operation on the degrees of the users. The degree of A decreases by 2, while the degrees of B and C remain unchanged. Consequently, the parity of the degree of every user remains invariant throughout the process.

Initially, we are given 1010 users with degree 1009 (odd) and 1009 users with degree 1010 (even). Let $X$ be the set of 1010 users with odd degrees, and $Y$ be the set of 1009 users with even degrees.

The goal is to reach a state where each user has at most one friend (the graph is a matching). Due to the parity invariants, the final state must have users in $X$ with degree 1 and users in $Y$ with degree 0. The target configuration $G_{target}$ is a perfect matching on $X$, with $Y$ being isolated.

**2. Analyzing the Initial Configuration**

We identify the structure of the initial graph $G_0$. We have $|X|=1010$ and $|Y|=1009$. The degrees are $d(x)=1009$ for $x \in X$ and $d(y)=1010$ for $y \in Y$.

Consider the complete bipartite graph $K_{X, Y}$. In this graph, the degree of any vertex in $X$ is $|Y|=1009$, and the degree of any vertex in $Y$ is $|X|=1010$. This matches the initial configuration. Thus, the initial graph $G_0$ is $K_{X, Y}$. Importantly, $X$ and $Y$ are independent sets in $G_0$.

**3. Construction of the Sequence of Events**

We provide an explicit construction of the sequence of events to reach $G_{target}$.
Let $X = \{X_1, \dots, X_{1010}\}$ and $Y = \{Y_1, \dots, Y_{1009}\}$.
We aim to create the following perfect matching $F$ on $X$:
$F = \{(X_1, X_2), (X_3, X_4), \dots, (X_{1009}, X_{1010})\}$.

**Phase 1: Creating the matching F and isolating $Y_1$.**

We use $Y_1$ to create the edges in $F$. We iterate $i = 1, 2, \dots, 505$.
In step $i$, we consider the vertices $Y_1, X_{2i-1}, X_{2i}$.
Initially, $Y_1$ is connected to all vertices in $X$. $X$ is an independent set.
The operation centered at $Y_1$ with the pair $(X_{2i-1}, X_{2i})$ is valid. It removes $(Y_1, X_{2i-1})$ and $(Y_1, X_{2i})$, and adds the edge $(X_{2i-1}, X_{2i})$.

We repeat this for all 505 pairs. The operations are valid sequentially as we are creating disjoint edges in $X$.

After Phase 1, the resulting graph $G_1$ has the following properties:
1. The degree of $Y_1$ has decreased by $2 \times 505 = 1010$. Thus, $Y_1$ is isolated.
2. The edges within $X$ form the perfect matching $F$.
3. Let $Y' = Y \setminus \{Y_1\}$. $|Y'|=1008$. $Y'$ remains independent.
4. The edges between $X$ and $Y'$ were unchanged. $G_1$ contains the complete bipartite graph $K_{X, Y'}$.

**Phase 2: Decoupling X from $Y'$.**

We now eliminate the edges of $K_{X, Y'}$ while preserving the structure of $F$ on $X$ and the independence of $Y'$. We use a composite operation called a "switch".

**The Switch Gadget:**
Consider a pair $(X_a, X_b) \in F$ and a pair $(Y_a, Y_b) \in Y'$. The induced subgraph on these four vertices has the edge $(X_a, X_b)$ and the four edges connecting $\{X_a, X_b\}$ to $\{Y_a, Y_b\}$. $Y_a$ and $Y_b$ are not connected.

We apply the following sequence of 4 operations, $S(X_a, X_b; Y_a, Y_b)$:

1. Center $X_a$, pair $(Y_a, Y_b)$. (Valid since $Y_a/Y_b$).
   Result: Removes $(X_a, Y_a), (X_a, Y_b)$. Adds $(Y_a, Y_b)$.
2. Center $X_b$, pair $(X_a, Y_a)$. (Valid since $X_a/Y_a$ after step 1).
   Result: Removes $(X_b, X_a), (X_b, Y_a)$. Adds $(X_a, Y_a)$.
3. Center $Y_a$, pair $(X_a, Y_b)$. (Valid since $X_a/Y_b$ after step 1).
   Result: Removes $(Y_a, X_a), (Y_a, Y_b)$. Adds $(X_a, Y_b)$.
4. Center $Y_b$, pair $(X_a, X_b)$. (Valid since $X_a/X_b$ after step 2).
   Result: Removes $(Y_b, X_a), (Y_b, X_b)$. Adds $(X_a, X_b)$.

The net effect of the switch operation is that it removes the four edges connecting $\{X_a, X_b\}$ to $\{Y_a, Y_b\}$, while preserving the edge $(X_a, X_b)$ and keeping $Y_a, Y_b$ disconnected at the end.

**Applying the Switches Systematically:**

We partition $Y'$ (1008 vertices) into 504 pairs:
$P_Y = \{(Y_2, Y_3), \dots, (Y_{1008}, Y_{1009})\}$.

We partition $F$ (505 pairs) into $F_A$ (the first 504 pairs) and $F_B$ (the last pair $(X_{1009}, X_{1010})$).

Step 2a: Decouple $F_A$ from $Y'$.
We match the 504 pairs in $F_A$ with the 504 pairs in $P_Y$. For each corresponding match, we apply the switch operation. This removes all edges between the vertices in $F_A$ ($X_1, \dots, X_{1008}$) and $Y'$.

Step 2b: Decouple $F_B$ from $Y'$.
We apply the switch between the pair $F_B=(X_{1009}, X_{1010})$ and every pair in $P_Y$. This removes all edges between $F_B$ and $Y'$.

**4. Conclusion**

After Phase 1 and Phase 2, all vertices in $X$ are disconnected from all vertices in $Y$. $Y_1$ was isolated in Phase 1, and $Y'$ was decoupled in Phase 2 while remaining independent. The perfect matching $F$ on $X$ is preserved.
The final graph is $G_{target}$, where every user in $X$ has exactly one friend (in $X$), and every user in $Y$ has zero friends. Thus, each user is friends with at most one other user.
