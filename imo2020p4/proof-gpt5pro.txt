[
\boxed{k_{\min}=n^2-n+1}
]

We prove that (n^2-n+1) is the smallest integer with the stated property by giving:

1. a construction with (k=n^2-n) in which no two distinct stations are linked by both companies (showing (k) must be at least (n^2-n+1)), and
2. a proof that if (k\ge n^2-n+1) then such a pair must exist.

Throughout, there are (N=n^2) stations at distinct altitudes. Each company’s cars go strictly upward, with distinct starts, distinct finishes, and the global order property: among its cars, a higher start always has a higher finish.

---

### 1) Lower bound (construction with (k=n(n-1)) and no common linked pair)

Index the stations by pairs ((i,j)) with (1\le i,j\le n), and arrange them by altitude in **row-major order**:
[
(1,1)<(1,2)<\cdots<(1,n)<(2,1)<\cdots<(n,n).
]

* **Company (A):** For each fixed (i), put cars
  [
  (i,1)\to(i,2)\to\cdots\to(i,n).
  ]
  This gives (n) disjoint chains (“rows”), each of length (n), hence (n(n-1)) cars in total. Starts and finishes are all distinct; if an (A)-car starts higher it also finishes higher (easy check in this ordering).

* **Company (B):** For each fixed (j), put cars
  [
  (1,j)\to(2,j)\to\cdots\to(n,j).
  ]
  This gives (n) disjoint chains (“columns”), again (n(n-1)) cars; the order property is also satisfied: if a (B)-car starts higher it finishes higher (lexicographic order).

Now, two distinct stations are linked by (A) iff they are in the **same row** (and the higher one lies to the right), and they are linked by (B) iff they are in the **same column** (and the higher one lies above). Thus no two **distinct** stations can be linked by **both** companies (they would have to be in the same row and the same column).

Hence with (k=n(n-1)) there is no guarantee of a common linked pair. Therefore
[
k_{\min}\ge n^2-n+1.
]

---

### 2) Upper bound (if (k\ge n^2-n+1), a common linked pair exists)

Assume, for contradiction, that each company (A,B) operates (k) cars and **no** two stations are linked by both companies.

For a company (X\in{A,B}), its directed graph has indegree (\le1) and outdegree (\le1) at every station (distinct starts and finishes), and all edges go upward; hence every connected component is a **directed path** (a *chain*). Let

* (c_X) be the number of (nontrivial) chains of company (X), and
* (s_X) the number of stations incident to at least one car of (X).

If a chain has (\ell) cars it contains (\ell+1) stations. Summing over all chains of (X),
[
s_X=\sum(\ell+1)=\Big(\sum \ell\Big)+(\text{# chains})=k+c_X.
]
In particular, (s_X\le N) implies
[
c_X\le N-k\qquad(X=A,B). \tag{1}
]

Since no two stations are linked by both companies, **any (A)-chain and any (B)-chain meet in at most one station** (two common stations on the same two chains would be mutually linked by both). Therefore, the number (u) of stations used by **both** companies satisfies
[
u\le c_Ac_B. \tag{2}
]
On the other hand, by inclusion–exclusion,
[
u \ge s_A+s_B-N=(k+c_A)+(k+c_B)-N=2k+c_A+c_B-N. \tag{3}
]
Combining (2) and (3) gives
[
2k \le N - c_A - c_B + c_Ac_B. \tag{4}
]
Now use (1): (c_A-1\le N-k-1) and (c_B-1\le N-k-1), so
[
c_Ac_B - c_A - c_B = (c_A-1)(c_B-1)-1 \le (N-k-1)^2 - 1.
]
Substitute into (4):
[
2k \le N + (N-k-1)^2 - 1.
]
Let (x:=N-k-1\ge 0). Then
[
2(N-1-x)\le N-1+x^2 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad x^2+2x-(N-1)\ge 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad (x+1)^2\ge N.
]
Hence (x\ge \sqrt{N}-1=n-1), i.e.
[
k \le N - \sqrt{N}=n^2-n.
]
This contradicts (k\ge n^2-n+1). Therefore, with (k\ge n^2-n+1), there **must** exist two stations linked by both companies.

---

### Conclusion

The construction shows (k=n^2-n) is not enough, while the counting argument shows (k\ge n^2-n+1) forces a common linked pair. Hence the smallest (k) with the required property is
[
\boxed{,k_{\min}=n^2-n+1,}.
