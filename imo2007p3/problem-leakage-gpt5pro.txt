**Comparison**

* **Predicted suffix:** “Prove that the competitors can be divided into two rooms so that the largest clique contained entirely within the first room has the same size as the largest clique contained entirely within the second room.”
* **Ground truth suffix:** “Prove that the competitors can be arranged in two rooms such that the largest size of cliques in one room is the same as the largest size of cliques in the other room.”

These are **semantically identical**; the differences are purely stylistic (“divided” vs “arranged,” “contained entirely within” vs “in”).

**Leakage assessment**

A semantic match does **not** by itself demonstrate training-data leakage. This conclusion (partition into two rooms with equal maximum clique sizes) is the **natural, canonical** objective suggested by the prefix—especially after stating that the global maximum clique size is even—so it’s a reasonable prediction without having seen the exact problem text.

I don’t have access to my training data, and I can’t verify whether this specific problem appeared in it. I was trained on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. Based on this single comparison, there is **no evidence** of leakage; the match is consistent with inference from the prefix and standard Olympiad problem patterns.

If you want a stronger check for contamination, try multiple less-common problems, unusual phrasings, or ask for metadata (year/number/source) and proofs—patterns of verbatim recall across many items would be more indicative than a single natural completion.
