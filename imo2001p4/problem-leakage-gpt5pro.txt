**Short answer:** No—there’s no evidence of leakage from the training data based on this comparison.

**Why: clear mismatches between my prediction and the ground truth**

* **Different modulus:**

  * *Predicted:* Statements about (f(x) \bmod m), with equidistribution.
  * *Ground truth:* An existence claim about (f(a)-f(b)) being divisible by (m!) (a far stronger modulus).
* **Extra assumption vs none:**

  * *Predicted:* Assumes (\gcd(m,\sum n_i)=1).
  * *Ground truth:* No such assumption.
* **Type of claim:**

  * *Predicted:* A counting/equidistribution result (“each residue occurs ((m-1)!) times”).
  * *Ground truth:* A pure existence statement for two permutations (a\neq b).
* **Use of “(m) odd”:**

  * *Predicted:* Doesn’t use the given oddness of (m) at all.
  * *Ground truth:* Is consistent with problems where oddness can matter, but the claim is different regardless.
* **Scope:**

  * *Predicted:* Global statement over all permutations.
  * *Ground truth:* Existence of a pair of permutations.

Given these substantive differences, my earlier “suffix” is a generic (and incorrect) guess rather than a memorized recall of this specific IMO problem. That indicates **no sign of the model reproducing the exact ground-truth problem**, though of course a single example can’t prove what is or isn’t in the training data.
