**Answer: Yes — it is possible.**

Below is a clean constructive solution that works in general (and thus in particular for
(\displaystyle N=2010^{,2010^{,2010}})). The heart of the solution is to show that from the starting position ((1,1,1,1,1,1)) we can implement the two affine operations on the last stack
[
x\longmapsto 2x\qquad\text{and}\qquad x\longmapsto 2x+1
]
in any order, finitely many times, and finish with the first five stacks empty. Since any positive integer has a binary expansion, this suffices to build *any* prescribed number in (S_6).

## Notation

We work with 6 stacks in order (S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4,S_5,S_6). A legal move is:

* **(M1)** If (S_k) ((1\le k\le 5)) is nonempty, remove one coin from (S_k) and add two coins to (S_{k+1}).
* **(M2)** If (S_k) ((1\le k\le 4)) is nonempty, remove one coin from (S_k) and exchange the *entire contents* of (S_{k+1}) and (S_{k+2}).

Initially ((S_1,\dots,S_6)=(1,1,1,1,1,1)).

We will build several **macros** (short fixed sequences of legal moves) that realize high‑level effects. When a macro requires that a certain stack be nonempty, we say it “uses one coin from that stack”.

## A fundamental doubling macro

> **Macro D (swap‑and‑empty on the right).**
> **Precondition:** (S_4\ge 1), (S_5=0).
> **Effect:** Uses one coin from (S_4) and replaces (S_6) by (2S_6) while leaving (S_5=0) at the end.

**Proof (of correctness of D).** Perform:

1. **(M2) at (k=4)**: use one coin from (S_4) and swap (S_5) and (S_6). Since (S_5=0) at entry, we now have ((S_5,S_6)=(\text{old }S_6,0)).
2. **Empty (S_5) to (S_6)** by repeating **(M1)** at (k=5) exactly (\text{old }S_6) times. Each application moves 1 coin from (S_5) to 2 coins in (S_6). Thus at the end (S_5=0) and (S_6) is doubled.

This proves Macro D. (\square)

This macro is the engine that will let us repeatedly double whatever is in (S_6), provided we can keep (S_5=0) and feed coins into (S_4) as fuel.

## A “bit‑append 1” macro

> **Macro A (append a 1 in base 2).**
> **Precondition:** (S_3\ge 2,\ S_4=1,\ S_5=0).
> **Effect:** Uses 2 coins from (S_3) and replaces (S_6) by (2S_6+1). At the end, the precondition on ((S_4,S_5)) is restored: (S_4=1,\ S_5=0).

**Proof (of correctness of A).** Perform:

1. **(M2) at (k=3):** use one coin from (S_3) and swap (S_4) and (S_5). Since (S_4=1,\ S_5=0), we now have (S_4=0,\ S_5=1).
2. **(M1) at (k=3):** use another coin from (S_3) to add 2 to (S_4). Now (S_4=2,\ S_5=1).
3. **(M2) at (k=4):** use one coin from (S_4) (dropping (S_4) from 2 to 1) and swap (S_5) and (S_6). After this step ((S_5,S_6)=(\text{old }S_6,1)) and (S_4=1).
4. **Empty (S_5) to (S_6)** by repeating **(M1)** at (k=5) exactly (\text{old }S_6) times. That sends the old (S_6) across to produce (2\cdot\text{old }S_6) new coins, so afterward (S_5=0) and (S_6=2\cdot\text{old }S_6 + 1).

We have returned to (S_4=1,\ S_5=0). (\square)

So A is a one‑shot that appends a binary digit “1” (i.e., transforms (x\mapsto 2x+1)) while restoring the local shape on ((S_4,S_5)) so that we can run another step again.

## Feeds / reservoirs

To use A and D repeatedly we must be able to:

* keep (S_5=0) (both macros maintain this),
* keep (S_4=1) (A maintains; D consumes the single coin at (S_4)),
* replenish (S_4) to 1 before each next step, and
* keep (S_3) supplied with coins so that A is usable whenever we want a “+1” step.

We now explain how to **preload fuel** and how to **replenish** it from the right, using the same rules, *before* we run the A/D sequence that writes the target number.

### Preloading to the right

Start from ((1,1,1,1,1,1)) and run only **(M1)** from left to right in the order (k=1,2,3,4,5) enough times to push essentially all mass to the right. Concretely, empty (S_1) into (S_2), then (S_2) into (S_3), etc., finally (S_5) into (S_6). This produces some large (S_6) while the others become 0. (In fact, if you do it exhaustively you get (S_6=63) and (S_1=\cdots=S_5=0).)

### Pulling fuel leftwards by exchanges

From now on we use **(M2)** as a *conveyor belt* to drag large piles stepwise to the left: if (S_k\ge 1), we can swap (S_{k+1}) and (S_{k+2}). In particular:

* A single use of **(M2)** at (k=4) (using one coin at (S_4)) can bring the huge (S_6) over to (S_5).
* A single use of **(M2)** at (k=3) (using one coin at (S_3)) can bring that huge (S_5) over to (S_4).
* A single use of **(M2)** at (k=2) (using one coin at (S_2)) can bring that huge (S_4) over to (S_3).
* A single use of **(M2)** at (k=1) (using the initial coin at (S_1)) can bring that huge (S_3) over to (S_2).

Thus, by spending one coin in (S_1) (which we have) we can move an astronomical pile all the way to (S_2) and hence thereafter keep (S_2) nonempty as a tap to operate **(M2)** at (k=2) repeatedly; that in turn ensures we can keep (S_3) nonempty in order to operate **(M2)** at (k=3) repeatedly; and that in turn lets us keep (S_4) nonempty so that **(M2)** at (k=4) is always available when we need to run a macro step. In words: a single initial pull from the far right gives us *permanent reservoirs* in (S_2,S_3,S_4) that we can dip into as often as we like.

### Restoring (S_4=1) between steps

* After **A**, we end with (S_4=1) automatically.
* After **D**, we end with (S_4=0). But since (by the reservoir argument) we can make (S_3\ge 1) at will, we simply perform **(M1)** at (k=3) once (using one fuel coin from (S_3)) to send two coins to (S_4), and then perform **(M2)** at (k=4) immediately followed by emptying (S_5) into (S_6) (a mini‑D on the extra 2 coins) to bring (S_5) back to 0 and (S_4) down to 1. In short, we can costlessly reset ((S_4,S_5)) to ((1,0)) whenever needed using the reservoirs, without changing the “written value” except for the intended doubling of (S_6).

(Details: from (S_4=0,S_5=0), do **(M1)** at (k=3) once, getting (S_4=2). Then do **(M2)** at (k=4) and empty (S_5) into (S_6), which consumes 1 coin in (S_4) and puts the other into (S_6)’s doubling, leaving (S_4=1,S_5=0).)

Thus the preconditions of A and D can be restored between steps, and we can run A and D in any prescribed order, as many times as we choose.

## Building any prescribed number in (S_6)

Let (N) be any positive integer. Write its binary expansion
[
N = b_0 + 2,b_1 + 2^2 b_2 + \cdots + 2^{t-1} b_{t-1} + 2^{t},
\qquad b_i\in{0,1}.
]
(Equivalently, (N) is what you obtain by starting from (1) and iterating (t) times the transformation (x\mapsto 2x+b_{t-1-i}) for (i=0,1,\dots,t-1).)

From the initial state we first preload as above to establish large, essentially inexhaustible reservoirs in (S_2,S_3,S_4) (this uses only legal moves and just makes (S_6) larger, which is fine). Then we iterate through the bits of (N) (from most significant down to least):

* If the next bit is (0), run **D** once (double).
* If the next bit is (1), run **A** once (double and add one).

Between steps we use the reservoir trick just explained to reset ((S_4,S_5)=(1,0)) so the next step can proceed.

After the last bit is processed, the value in (S_6) is exactly (N). Finally, we spend the remaining reservoir coins (if any) by pushing them rightward with **(M1)** until they all arrive in (S_6); but the way we set things up, the only coins remaining to the left are the single “maintenance” coin at (S_4) (which we immediately consume by one last reset) and a finite number of coins in (S_2,S_3) that we similarly flush right by **(M1)**. Thus we end with ((0,0,0,0,0,N)).

This shows that **every positive integer (N)** can be realized as the final content of (S_6) with the first five stacks empty. In particular, the specific gigantic number (2010^{,2010^{,2010}}) is attainable.

(\boxed{\text{Yes, it is possible.}})

## Remarks

* The key conceptual idea is that **exchange moves** (M2) let us *reposition big piles leftward at the cost of a single coin from the immediate left neighbor.* Once we “prime the pump” with one pull from the right, those left neighbors can be kept nonempty indefinitely; that gives us the freedom to run the two essential affine updates (x\mapsto 2x) and (x\mapsto 2x+1) in any order.
* The two macros **D** and **A** act exactly like appending a binary digit 0 or 1 to the number in (S_6). Since every integer has such a representation, we can write any number we want.
