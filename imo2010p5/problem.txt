Six stacks S_1, . . . , S_6 of coins are standing in a row. In the beginning every stack contains
a single coin. There are two types of allowed moves:\\
Move 1 : If stack Sk with 1 \le k \le 5 contains at least one coin, you may remove one coin
from S_k and add two coins to S_{k+1}.\\
Move 2 : If stack Sk with 1 \le k \le 4 contains at least one coin, then you may remove
one coin from S_k and exchange stacks S_{k+1} and S_{k+2}.
Decide whether it is possible to achieve by a sequence of such moves that the first five stacks
are empty, whereas the sixth stack S_6 contains exactly 2010^{2010^{2010}} coins.
