The problem asks whether it is possible to reach a state where the first five stacks are empty and the sixth stack $S_6$ contains $N = 2010^{2010^{2010}}$ coins, starting from the initial configuration $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$. We will show that this is impossible by analyzing the maximum number of coins achievable in $S_6$ and demonstrating that it is significantly smaller than $N$.

The allowed moves are:
Move 1 (M1(k)): Remove one coin from $S_k$ and add two coins to $S_{k+1}$ ($1 \le k \le 5$).
Move 2 (M2(k)): Remove one coin from $S_k$ and swap $S_{k+1}$ and $S_{k+2}$ ($1 \le k \le 4$).

**Pumping Operation (Exponentiation)**
The combination of these moves allows for an exponential "Pumping" operation. Using three stacks $(S_k, S_{k+1}, S_{k+2})$ with configuration $(A, B, C)$, we can achieve a configuration with $(C+2B) \cdot 2^A$ coins in $S_{k+2}$ by repeatedly swapping $S_{k+1}$ and $S_{k+2}$ using M2(k) and emptying $S_{k+1}$ into $S_{k+2}$ using M1(k+1).

**Maximum Achievable Number of Coins**
We analyze the maximum number of coins achievable in each stack, denoted by $M_k$.

$M_1=1$.
$M_2$. $(1, 1) \to (0, 3)$. $M_2=3$.
$M_3$. $(1, 1, 1) \to (0, 3, 1) \to (0, 0, 7)$. $M_3=7$.

To maximize $M_k$ for $k \ge 4$, we can use a Pumping operation involving the preceding stacks. We consider a sequential strategy where we maximize the inputs to the Pump using the resources generated by the earlier stacks.

$M_4$. We use Pump(2). We maximize the exponent in $S_2$ using $S_1$.
$(1, 1, 1, 1) \to (0, 3, 1, 1)$.
Pump(2) with input $(3, 1, 1)$ yields $(1+2) \cdot 2^3 = 24$. $M_4=24$.

$M_5$. We use Pump(3). Maximize the exponent in $S_3$.
$(1, \dots, 1) \to (0, 0, 7, 1, 1)$.
Pump(3) with input $(7, 1, 1)$ yields $3 \cdot 2^7 = 384$. $M_5=384$.

$M_6$. We use Pump(4). Maximize the exponent in $S_4$.
$(1, \dots, 1) \to (0, 0, 0, 24, 1, 1)$.
Pump(4) with input $(24, 1, 1)$ yields $3 \cdot 2^{24}$.
$M_6 = 3 \cdot 2^{24} = 50,331,648$.

This sequential strategy achieves a double exponential number.

**Analysis of Alternative Strategies (Iteration)**
To achieve faster growth (e.g., tetration), we might try to iterate the Pumping operation, using the output as input for the next iteration. This requires feedback, implemented using swaps (M2).

Consider iterating using $(S_4, S_5, S_6)$. To feed the output from $S_6$ back to $S_4$ (to be used as the new exponent), we need two swaps: Swap($S_5, S_6$) using $S_4$, and Swap($S_4, S_5$) using $S_3$.

The resources for $S_3$ and $S_4$ are limited by what can be generated by the preceding stacks ($M_3=7, M_4=24$).
Let $X_i$ be the exponent used at iteration $i$. $X_{i+1} \approx 2^{X_i}$.
The total cost in $S_3$ is the number of iterations $N_i$. The total cost in $S_4$ is approximately $\sum X_i$.
Constraints: $N_i \le 7$, $\sum X_i \le 24$.

To maximize the output, we choose the sequence: $X_0=1, X_1=2, X_2=4, X_3=16$. Sum=23. $N_i=4$.
The final output is $X_4=2^{16}=65536$.

This iteration strategy yields a smaller number than the sequential strategy. The overhead of control (swaps) and the limited resources constrain the achievable magnitude, making it less efficient than a single large Pump operation.

**Conclusion**
The analysis suggests that the maximum achievable number of coins in $S_6$ is bounded by the result of the sequential strategy, $M_6 = 3 \cdot 2^{24}$. This is because the structure of the system with 6 stacks allows for at most two levels of exponential Pumping composed sequentially, leading to double exponential growth.

We compare $M_6 \approx 5 \cdot 10^7$ with the target number $N = 2010^{2010^{2010}}$.
$N$ is a vastly larger number. We estimate its magnitude:
$\log_{10}(\log_{10}(N)) \approx \log_{10}(2010^{2010} \log_{10}(2010)) \approx 2010 \log_{10}(2010) \approx 2010 \cdot 3.3 \approx 6633$.
So $N$ has approximately $10^{6633}$ digits.

Since the maximum achievable number of coins in $S_6$ is significantly smaller than $N$, it is impossible to achieve the target configuration.
