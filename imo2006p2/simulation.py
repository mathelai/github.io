IMO 2006 Problem 2 Simulation

This simulation analyzes a regular 2006-gon dissected into triangles.
A diagonal is "good" if it divides the boundary into two parts with odd numbers of sides.
The goal is to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two good sides.

Key insights:
1. For a regular 2006-gon, vertices are labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., 2005
2. A diagonal from vertex i to vertex j is good if both |j-i| and |2006-(j-i)| are odd
3. Since 2006 is even, |j-i| + |2006-(j-i)| = 2006, so if one is odd, the other is too
4. Therefore, a diagonal is good iff |j-i| is odd
5. Sides connect consecutive vertices, so |j-i| = 1 (odd), making all sides good
6. An isosceles triangle in a regular polygon has at least two sides of equal length
7. We need to find dissections that maximize isosceles triangles with 2+ good sides

        Key observation: Triangles with vertices (i, i+1, i+2) are ideal:
        - They have sides connecting consecutive vertices: (i,i+1), (i+1,i+2), (i,i+2)
        - Sides (i,i+1) and (i+1,i+2) both have arc length 1 (GOOD)
        - Side (i,i+2) has arc length 2 (NOT GOOD since 2 is even)
        - Triangle is ISOSCELES: chord(i,i+1) = chord(i+1,i+2)
