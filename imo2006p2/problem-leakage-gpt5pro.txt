**Verdict: No leakage indicated.**

**Why:**
Your *ground truth suffix* asks:

* “Find the **maximum number of isosceles triangles** having **two good sides**…”

My *predicted suffix* instead asserted:

* “Prove that **at least 1003** of the triangles have **exactly two** good sides (no isosceles condition), and show this lower bound is tight.”

**Key mismatches:**

| Aspect                | Ground Truth             | Predicted                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Triangle type         | **Isosceles** only       | **All** triangles                 |
| Quantity to determine | **Maximum** number       | **Minimum** (lower bound) number  |
| Condition on sides    | Two good sides           | **Exactly** two good sides        |
| Nature of task        | Optimization (max count) | Existence/lower bound + tightness |

Because the predicted suffix does **not** match the ground truth (it changes the objective, triangle class, and quantifier), this response does not show verbatim recall of the original problem. While absence of a match cannot *prove* the model was never exposed to the problem during training, this comparison provides **no evidence of memorization or leakage** in this instance.
