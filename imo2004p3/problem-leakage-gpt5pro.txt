**Short answer:** No clear evidence of leakage.

**Why: a side‑by‑side comparison**

| Aspect           | My predicted suffix                                            | Ground truth suffix                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Board shape      | Only **squares** (n\times n)                                   | **All rectangles** (m\times n)                                        |
| Task             | Decide for which (n) a tiling exists                           | Determine **all** (m,n) for which a tiling exists                     |
| Overlaps/gaps    | “completely tiled… pairwise non‑overlapping” (implies no gaps) | Explicitly: “without gaps and without overlaps”                       |
| Outside coverage | Not explicitly stated (implicit in “board is covered”)         | **Explicitly**: “no part of a hook covers area outside the rectangle” |
| Transformations  | Rotations/reflections allowed                                  | Same                                                                  |

**Interpretation**

* The prediction captures the **general theme** (tiling with hooks under rotations/reflections, exact cover), but it is a **narrower, different problem** (only (n\times n) boards).
* Phrasing and scope **do not match**; if this were verbatim recall of the specific IMO problem, we would expect the (m\times n) formulation and the explicit “outside the rectangle” clause.

**Verdict**

Given the mismatch in scope and wording, this looks like a **pattern‑based guess** of a standard tiling question rather than recall of the specific problem. From this comparison alone, there’s **no indication of problem leakage** in training.

*(General note: I don’t have visibility into my training set. I was trained on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. The conclusion above is based solely on the textual comparison you asked for.)*
