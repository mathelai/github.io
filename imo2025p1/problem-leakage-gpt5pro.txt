**Conclusion: No leakage detected.**

Your provided ground truth suffix and my earlier *predicted* suffix are substantially different in structure, objects, constraints, and objective. Similarity is limited to the shared use of the term “sunny line,” which comes directly from the given prefix and is therefore unavoidable.

| Primary objects | A subset (S) of lattice points in an (n\times n) grid (G_n)    | (n) distinct lines in the plane                                                                     | No                  |                                                                              |    |
| Core constraint | Every sunny line contains **at most two** points of (S)        | Every integer point ((a,b)) with (a,b>0) and (a+b\le n+1) lies on **at least one** of the (n) lines | No                  |                                                                              |    |

| Lattice region  | Full (n\times n) grid                                          | Triangular set ({(a,b)\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}^2: a+b\le n+1})                                            | No                  |                                                                              |    |
| Structural type | Extremal set problem on points vs lines                        | Existence/characterization problem about line families                                              | No                  |                                                                              |    |

Because the predicted suffix does **not** reproduce or closely paraphrase the ground truth, there is no evidence here that the model recalled the exact problem statement from training data.
