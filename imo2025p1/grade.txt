**Expected Score: 4/7**

**CORRECTNESS ISSUE**: The claimed answer k∈{0,1} is **INCORRECT**. See SOLUTION_STATUS.md for details.


## Grading

According to IMO grading standards for a 7-point problem:

### Actual Score: 4/7 points

**What works:**
- ✓ Proves k = 0 is achievable (correct constructive proof using vertical/horizontal lines)
- ✓ Proves k = 1 is achievable (correct constructive proof)
- ✓ Clear problem setup and definitions
- ✓ Well-organized structure

**Major issues preventing higher score:**
- ✗ **INCORRECT CLAIM**: States k ≥ 2 is impossible, but this is FALSE
- ✗ The "coverage efficiency argument" in Part 3 has logical gaps
- ✗ Simulation data in results.json contains INVALID configurations (uses more than n lines)
- ✗ No rigorous proof that k=2, k=3, etc. are impossible

**Assessment:**
This solution earns partial credit (4/7) for correctly proving k=0 and k=1 are achievable. However, the claim that k ≥ 2 is impossible is incorrect, and the proof attempt has significant gaps. The actual characterization of all achievable k values remains an open problem.

**To achieve 7/7:** Either:
1. Rigorously prove k ∈ {0, 1} (if this is actually true), OR
2. Find the correct characterization and prove it completely
