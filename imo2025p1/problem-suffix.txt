Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both of the following conditions:
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and
\item[(ii)] exactly $k$ of the $n$ lines are sunny.
\end{itemize}
