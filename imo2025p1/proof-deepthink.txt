Let $S_n$ be the set of points $(a,b)$ such that $a, b$ are positive integers and $a+b \le n+1$. A line is called sunny if it is not parallel to the $x$-axis (Horizontal, H, slope 0), the $y$-axis (Vertical, V, slope $\infty$), or the line $x+y=0$ (Diagonal, D, slope $-1$). We want to determine all possible values of $k$, the number of sunny lines among $n$ distinct lines covering $S_n$, for a given integer $n\ge 3$.

We will show that the possible values for $k$ are $0, 1, 3$.

Part 1: Constructions for $k=0, 1, 3$.

1.  **$k=0$**: The $n$ vertical lines $x=1, x=2, \dots, x=n$ cover $S_n$. Since $1\le a \le n$ for any $(a,b) \in S_n$. All these lines are non-sunny.
2.  **$k=1$**: The $n-1$ vertical lines $x=1, \dots, x=n-1$ cover all points in $S_n$ except $(n,1)$. We cover $(n,1)$ with the line $y=x-(n-1)$. This line has slope 1, which is sunny.
3.  **$k=3$**: We provide an explicit construction for any $n\ge 3$. We use $n-3$ vertical lines $x=1, \dots, x=n-3$. These are non-sunny.
    The remaining points form the set $R = S_n \setminus \{x=1, \dots, x=n-3\}$. $R$ consists of 6 points:
    $R = \{(n-2, 1), (n-2, 2), (n-2, 3), (n-1, 1), (n-1, 2), (n, 1)\}$.
    We cover these 6 points with 3 sunny lines:
    $L_1$: $y=x-(n-3)$ (slope 1). Covers $(n-2, 1)$ and $(n-1, 2)$.
    $L_2$: $2x+y=2n-1$ (slope $-2$). Covers $(n-2, 3)$ and $(n-1, 1)$.
    $L_3$: $x+2y=n+2$ (slope $-1/2$). Covers $(n-2, 2)$ and $(n, 1)$.
    These three lines are sunny. Thus $k=3$ is possible.

Part 2: Proof that $k=2$ and $k\ge 4$ are impossible.

We first prove a crucial lemma about covering $S_m$ entirely with sunny lines.

**Lemma 1**: $S_m$ can be covered by $m$ sunny lines if and only if $m=1$ or $m=3$.

Proof:
For $m=1$, $S_1=\{(1,1)\}$. $y=x$ (sunny) covers it.
For $m=2$, $S_2=\{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1)\}$. The lines connecting pairs of these points are $x=1$ (V), $y=1$ (H), $x+y=3$ (D). A sunny line can cover at most one point of $S_2$. We need 3 sunny lines. So $m=2$ is impossible.
For $m=3$, we have the construction: $y=x, 2x+y=5, x+2y=5$. This works.

Now consider $m\ge 4$. Suppose $S_m$ is covered by $m$ sunny lines $L_1, \dots, L_m$.
Let $A_1 = \{(1, j) : 1\le j \le m\}$ be the points in the first column. Since the lines are sunny (not V), each line covers at most one point in $A_1$. Since $|A_1|=m$, each line must cover exactly one point in $A_1$.
Similarly, let $R_1 = \{(i, 1) : 1\le i \le m\}$ be the points in the first row. Each line must cover exactly one point in $R_1$.

Let $L_1$ be the line covering $(1,1)$. It cannot cover any other point in $A_1$ or $R_1$.
The remaining $m-1$ lines establish a bijection between $A_1\setminus\{(1,1)\}$ and $R_1\setminus\{(1,1)\}$. Let this be defined by a permutation $\sigma$ of $\{2, \dots, m\}$, such that for $i\in\{2, \dots, m\}$, the line $L_i$ connects $(i, 1)$ and $(1, \sigma(i))$.
The slope of $L_i$ is $m_i = \frac{\sigma(i)-1}{1-i}$. Since $L_i$ is sunny, $m_i \ne -1$. This means $\sigma(i)-1 \ne i-1$, so $\sigma(i) \ne i$. Thus $\sigma$ must be a derangement.

Consider the point $(2,2)$ (since $m\ge 3$). It must be covered.
If $L_i$ ($i\ge 2$) covers $(2,2)$. $L_i$ connects $(i, 1)$ and $(1, \sigma(i))$.
If $i=2$, $L_2$ connects $(2,1)$ and $(1, \sigma(2))$. If $(2,2)$ is on $L_2$, the slope between $(2,1)$ and $(2,2)$ is $\infty$. $L_2$ is $x=2$ (V). Not sunny.
Thus, $(2,2)$ must be covered by $L_1$. $L_1$ passes through $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$, so $L_1$ is $y=x$ (sunny).

Now consider the point $(m-1, 2)$. It is in $S_m$ since $(m-1)+2=m+1$.
Since $m\ge 4$, $m-1 \ne 2$. So $(m-1, 2)$ is not on $L_1$.
It must be covered by some $L_i$ ($i\ge 2$). $L_i$ connects $(i, 1)$ and $(1, \sigma(i))$.
The slope between $(i, 1)$ and $(m-1, 2)$ is $\frac{2-1}{m-1-i} = \frac{1}{m-1-i}$.
The slope of $L_i$ is $m_i = \frac{\sigma(i)-1}{1-i}$.
We must have $\frac{1}{m-1-i} = \frac{\sigma(i)-1}{1-i}$.
$(1-i) = (\sigma(i)-1)(m-1-i)$.
$1-i = \sigma(i)(m-1) - i\sigma(i) - (m-1) + i$.
$m-2i = \sigma(i)(m-1-i) - (m-1)$.

Let's use a different approach based on the condition derived in the thought process: $(i'-2)(j'-2)=1$ for $(2,2)$ and $(i'-2)(j'-m+1)=m-2$ for $(m-1, 2)$, where $i', j'$ are the coordinates on the boundaries. In the notation used here, $L_i$ connects $(i, 1)$ and $(1, \sigma(i))$.

Let's analyze the condition for $(m-1, 2)$ on the line connecting $(i, 1)$ and $(1, \sigma(i))$.
The equation of the line $L_i$ is $y-1 = m_i (x-i)$.
$(2-1) = \frac{\sigma(i)-1}{1-i} (m-1-i)$.
$1-i = (\sigma(i)-1)(m-1-i)$.
Since $i\ge 2$, $1-i \ne 0$.
If $m-1-i \ne 0$ (i.e., $i \ne m-1$).
$\frac{1-i}{m-1-i} = \sigma(i)-1$.
$\sigma(i) = 1 + \frac{1-i}{m-1-i} = 1 + \frac{i-1}{i-(m-1)}$.
We need $\sigma(i)$ to be an integer. So $i-(m-1)$ must divide $i-1$.
$i-(m-1)$ also divides $(i-1) - (i-(m-1)) = m-2$.
Let $d = i-(m-1)$. $d$ divides $m-2$. Also $i=d+m-1$.
Since $2\le i \le m$.
If $i=m$. $d=1$. $1$ divides $m-2$. $\sigma(m) = 1 + \frac{m-1}{1} = m$. This contradicts the condition that $\sigma$ is a derangement.
If $2\le i \le m-2$. Then $m-1-i \ge 1$.
$d = i-(m-1) \le m-2-(m-1)=-1$.
If $d=-1$. $i=m-2$. $-1$ divides $m-2$. $\sigma(m-2) = 1 + \frac{m-3}{-1} = 1-(m-3) = 4-m$.
If $m=4$. $\sigma(2)=0$. Impossible since $\sigma(i)\ge 2$.
If $m\ge 5$. $\sigma(i)\le -1$. Impossible.

If $i=m-1$. The line $L_{m-1}$ connects $(m-1, 1)$ and $(1, \sigma(m-1))$.
If $(m-1, 2)$ is on this line, the line must be $x=m-1$ (V). Not sunny.

In all cases, we reached a contradiction. Thus, $S_m$ cannot be covered by $m$ sunny lines if $m\ge 4$.
Lemma 1 is proved.

Now we use Lemma 1 and an inductive argument based on boundary removal.

**Lemma 2 (Boundary Removal)**: If $k<n$, then any configuration of $n$ lines covering $S_n$ with $k$ sunny lines must contain at least one of the boundary lines $x=1$, $y=1$, or $x+y=n+1$.

Proof: Let $L$ be the configuration. $L_S$ (sunny lines), $L_{NS}$ (non-sunny lines). $|L_S|=k, |L_{NS}|=n-k$.
Suppose none of the boundary lines are in $L$. Since they are non-sunny, they are not in $L_{NS}$.
Consider $A_1$ (first column). Since $x=1 \notin L_{NS}$. Lines in $L_{NS}$ are H, D, or V ($x=c, c>1$).
$L_S$ covers at most $k$ points of $A_1$.
$L_{NS}$. V lines ($c>1$) cover 0 points. H or D lines cover at most 1 point each.
If there is a V line ($c>1$), then the remaining $n-k-1$ lines in $L_{NS}$ must cover at least $n-k$ points of $A_1$ (together with $L_S$ covering $k$). This is impossible.
So $L_{NS}$ consists only of H or D lines.

Similarly, considering $R_1$ (first row) and $y=1 \notin L_{NS}$, $L_{NS}$ consists only of V or D lines.
Thus, $L_{NS}$ must consist entirely of D lines.

Now consider the diagonal boundary $D_{n+1} = \{(a,b) : a+b=n+1\}$. $|D_{n+1}|=n$.
Since $x+y=n+1 \notin L_{NS}$. The lines in $L_{NS}$ are $x+y=c$ with $c\le n$. These lines do not intersect $D_{n+1}$. So $L_{NS}$ covers 0 points of $D_{n+1}$.
$D_{n+1}$ must be covered by $L_S$. A sunny line ($m\ne -1$) intersects $x+y=n+1$ at exactly one point.
So $L_S$ covers at most $k$ points.
We need $k\ge n$. This contradicts the assumption $k<n$.
Thus, at least one of the boundary lines must be in $L$. Since these lines are non-sunny, they must be in $L_{NS}$.

**Conclusion**:
Let $K(n)$ be the set of possible values of $k$ for a given $n$.
We want to show that if $k \in K(n)$ and $k\notin \{0, 1, 3\}$, we reach a contradiction.
Suppose $k=2$ or $k\ge 4$.

If $k=n$. By Lemma 1, this is impossible since $k\ge 2$ and $k\ne 3$. (We are given $n\ge 3$. If $n=3, k=3$. If $n>3, k\ne n$).

If $k<n$. By Lemma 2, there is a boundary line $L_B \in L_{NS}$.
Let $L' = L \setminus \{L_B\}$. $L'$ has $n-1$ lines and $k$ sunny lines.
$L'$ covers $S' = S_n \setminus L_B$.
$S'$ is isomorphic to $S_{n-1}$. (If $L_B$ is $x=1$ or $y=1$, $S'$ is a translation of $S_{n-1}$. If $L_B$ is $x+y=n+1$, $S'=S_{n-1}$).
Since the sunny property is preserved under translation (slopes are preserved), we obtain a configuration for $S_{n-1}$ with $k$ sunny lines. So $k \in K(n-1)$.

We can repeat this argument as long as $k<m$. We apply the reduction $n-k$ times.
We arrive at a configuration for $S_k$ with $k$ lines and $k$ sunny lines.
So $S_k$ is covered by $k$ sunny lines.
By Lemma 1, $k$ must be 1 or 3.
This contradicts the assumption that $k=2$ or $k\ge 4$.

Therefore, the only possible values for $k$ are $0, 1, 3$.
