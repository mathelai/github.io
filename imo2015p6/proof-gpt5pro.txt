Let ( (a_j)*{j\ge 1} ) be integers with
[
1\le a_j\le 2015\quad\text{and}\quad k+a_k\ne \ell+a*\ell\ \ (k<\ell).
]
Write (s_j:=j+a_j). Thus the (s_j) are pairwise distinct and satisfy
[
j+1\le s_j\le j+2015\quad\text{for all }j.
]

We will prove there exist integers (b) and (N) such that for all (n>m\ge N),
[
\left|\sum_{j=m+1}^n (a_j-b)\right|\le 1007^2.
]

### 1) Eventually every large integer occurs as some (s_j)

For any (T\ge 2015), the indices (j=1,2,\dots,T-2015) satisfy
[
s_j\le j+2015\le T,
]
and the (s_j) are distinct. Hence among the integers ({1,2,\dots,T}) at most (2015) are missing from the set ({s_j:j\ge 1}). As (T) increases, the number of missing integers is nondecreasing and always (\le 2015), so only finitely many integers are missing in total. Therefore there is an (N_0) such that every integer (t\ge N_0) equals (s_j) for a unique (j).

---

### 2) The number of “active intervals” stabilizes

For an integer (t), define
[
A(t):=#{j:\ j\le t<s_j},
]
the number of “active” indices at time (t). When time increases by (1), one new index (j=t+1) starts, and there is an end at time (t+1) iff (t+1) equals some (s_j). Thus
[
A(t+1)=A(t)+1-\mathbf{1}_{{t+1\in {s_j}}}.
]
By Step 1, for all (t\ge N_0) we have (t+1=s_j) for exactly one (j), so the indicator equals (1) and hence
[
A(t+1)=A(t)\qquad (t\ge N_0).
]
Therefore (A(t)) is constant for all (t\ge N_0); denote this constant by
[
b:=A(t)\in{1,2,\dots,2015}\qquad (t\ge N_0).
]

At each (t\ge N_0) there is exactly one end at (t+1), so among the (b) active intervals at time (t) one has exactly one unit of time left.

---

### 3) A telescoping identity via the “sum of remaining times”

For (t\ge N_0), let
[
S(t):=\sum_{j:, j\le t<s_j} (s_j-t)
]
be the sum of the remaining times of the (b) active intervals at time (t). From time (t) to (t+1), each of the (b) remaining times decreases by (1), one interval ends, and a new interval starts with remaining time (a_{t+1}). Hence
[
S(t+1)-S(t)=a_{t+1}-b\qquad (t\ge N_0).
]
Summing from (t=m) to (n-1) gives, for all (n>m\ge N_0),
[
\sum_{j=m+1}^n (a_j-b)=S(n)-S(m).\tag{*}
]

Thus our task reduces to bounding (S(t)) uniformly for (t\ge N_0).

---

### 4) Bounding (S(t))

Fix (t\ge N_0). The set of remaining times at time (t) is
[
{,s_j-t:\ j\le t<s_j,}\subset{1,2,\dots,2015}.
]
It consists of exactly (b) **distinct** numbers (because the (s_j) are distinct) and, as noted above, it **contains (1)** (since exactly one interval ends at time (t+1)). Let us list these numbers in increasing order as
[
1=x_1<x_2<\cdots< x_b\le 2015 .
]
Then
[
S(t)=x_1+\cdots+x_b.
]
The minimum possible value of (S(t)) is when ({x_i}={1,2,\dots,b}), giving
[
S(t)\ge \frac{b(b+1)}{2}.
]

For an upper bound, note that among the (b-1) numbers (x_2,\dots,x_b), the (i)-th smallest (for (i=2,\dots,b)) cannot exceed the (i)-th smallest in the set of the (b-1) largest numbers of ({2,3,\dots,2015}). Hence for (i=2,\dots,b),
[
x_i\le (2016-b)+(i-1).
]
Therefore
[
\begin{aligned}
S(t)&=1+\sum_{i=2}^b x_i
\ \le\ 1+\sum_{i=2}^b\bigl((2016-b)+(i-1)\bigr)\
&=1+(b-1)(2016-b)+\frac{(b-1)b}{2}
=\frac{b(b+1)}{2}+(b-1)(2015-b).
\end{aligned}
]
Thus, for all (t\ge N_0),
[
\frac{b(b+1)}{2}\ \le\ S(t)\ \le\ \frac{b(b+1)}{2}+(b-1)(2015-b).
]
In particular, all the values (S(t)) (for (t\ge N_0)) lie in an interval of length at most
[
(b-1)(2015-b)\ \le\ \max_{1\le b\le 2015}(b-1)(2015-b)
=\left(\frac{2014}{2}\right)^2=1007^2.
]

---

### 5) Conclusion

Choose (N:=N_0) and (b:=A(t)) (the constant value for (t\ge N_0)). Then for all integers (n>m\ge N), by ((*)) and the bound on (S),
[
\left|\sum_{j=m+1}^n (a_j-b)\right|
=|S(n)-S(m)|
\le 1007^2.
]
This proves the assertion. (\square)

**Remark.** The bound (1007^2) is optimal: the quadratic ((b-1)(2015-b)) attains its maximum (1007^2) at (b=1008).
