Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three points of $\mathcal{S}$ are collinear. By a windmill we mean a process as follows. Start with a line $\ell$ going through a point $P \in \mathcal{S}$. Rotate $\ell$ clockwise around the pivot $P$ until the line contains another point $Q$ of $\mathcal{S}$. The point $Q$ now takes over as the new pivot. This process continues indefinitely, with the pivot always being a point from $\mathcal{S}$.

Show that for a suitable $P \in \mathcal{S}$ and a suitable starting line $\ell$ containing $P$, the resulting windmill will visit each point of $\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot infinitely often.

Solution. Give the rotating line an orientation and distinguish its sides as the oranje side and the blue side. Notice that whenever the pivot changes from some point $T$ to another point $U$, after the change, $T$ is on the same side as $U$ was before. Therefore, the number of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ on the oranje side and the number of those on the blue side remain the same throughout the whole process (except for those moments when the line contains two points).\\

First consider the case that $|\mathcal{S}|=2 n+1$ is odd. We claim that through any point $T \in \mathcal{S}$, there is a line that has $n$ points on each side. To see this, choose an oriented line through $T$ containing no other point of $\mathcal{S}$ and suppose that it has $n+r$ points on its oranje side. If $r=0$ then we have established the claim, so we may assume that $r \neq 0$. As the line rotates through $180^{\circ}$ around $T$, the number of points of $\mathcal{S}$ on its oranje side changes by 1 whenever the line passes through a point; after $180^{\circ}$, the number of points on the oranje side is $n-r$. Therefore there is an intermediate stage at which the oranje side, and thus also the blue side, contains $n$ points.

Now select the point $P$ arbitrarily, and choose a line through $P$ that has $n$ points of $\mathcal{S}$ on each side to be the initial state of the windmill. We will show that during a rotation over $180^{\circ}$, the line of the windmill visits each point of $\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot. To see this, select any point $T$ of $\mathcal{S}$ and select a line $\ell$ through $T$ that separates $\mathcal{S}$ into equal halves. The point $T$ is the unique point of $\mathcal{S}$ through which a line in this direction can separate the points of $\mathcal{S}$ into equal halves (parallel translation would disturb the balance). Therefore, when the windmill line is parallel to $\ell$, it must be $\ell$ itself, and so pass through $T$.

Next suppose that $|\mathcal{S}|=2 n$. Similarly to the odd case, for every $T \in \mathcal{S}$ there is an oriented\\
line through $T$ with $n-1$ points on its oranje side and $n$ points on its blue side. Select such an oriented line through an arbitrary $P$ to be the initial state of the windmill.\\
We will now show that during a rotation over $360^{\circ}$, the line of the windmill visits each point of $\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot. To see this, select any point $T$ of $\mathcal{S}$ and an oriented line $\ell$ through $T$ that separates $\mathcal{S}$ into two subsets with $n-1$ points on its oranje and $n$ points on its blue side. Again, parallel translation would change the numbers of points on the two sides, so when the windmill line is parallel to $\ell$ with the same orientation, the windmill line must pass through $T$.

Comment. One may shorten this solution in the following way.\\
Suppose that $|\mathcal{S}|=2 n+1$. Consider any line $\ell$ that separates $\mathcal{S}$ into equal halves; this line is unique given its direction and contains some point $T \in \mathcal{S}$. Consider the windmill starting from this line. When the line has made a rotation of $180^{\circ}$, it returns to the same location but the oranje side becomes blue and vice versa. So, for each point there should have been a moment when it appeared as pivot, as this is the only way for a point to pass from on side to the other.

Now suppose that $|\mathcal{S}|=2 n$. Consider a line having $n-1$ and $n$ points on the two sides; it contains some point $T$. Consider the windmill starting from this line. After having made a rotation of $180^{\circ}$, the windmill line contains some different point $R$, and each point different from $T$ and $R$ has changed the color of its side. So, the windmill should have passed through all the points.
