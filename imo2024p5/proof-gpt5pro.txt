**Answer: (\boxed{4}).**

---

We prove two things:

1. No strategy can guarantee success by the 3rd attempt (a lower bound (n\ge 4)).
2. There is a strategy that always succeeds on the 4th attempt (an upper bound (n\le 4)).

Together these imply the minimum (n) is (4).

## 1) Lower bound: (3) attempts are not enough

Fix any strategy Turbo may use (possibly adaptive). We will construct a placement of the monsters (consistent with the rules) that defeats Turbo’s first three attempts.

Let Turbo’s first attempt end at a monster in row (r_1) and column (c_1).
Let his second attempt end at a monster in row (r_2) and column (c_2), with ((r_2,c_2)\ne(r_1,c_1)). WLOG (r_1<r_2).

Consider his third attempt. To go from the first row to the last row, the path must cross every row, in particular all rows strictly between (r_1) and (r_2). In that open horizontal strip
[
\mathcal S:={(r,c): r_1<r<r_2}
]
we know nothing yet about where the monsters are, except that in each row of (\mathcal S) there is exactly one monster, and none of those monsters lies in columns (c_1) or (c_2) (because rows (r_1,r_2) already contain the monsters of (c_1,c_2)).

Look at Turbo’s third path through (\mathcal S). One of the following must happen first inside (\mathcal S).

* **Case A.** He moves horizontally in some row (r\in(r_1,r_2)) from a column in ({c_1,c_2}) into a different column (d\notin{c_1,c_2}).

* **Case B.** He never enters any other column in (\mathcal S). Then he is confined to columns ({c_1,c_2}) while traversing (\mathcal S). But to avoid ((r_1,c_1)) and ((r_2,c_2)), he must switch from one of these columns to the other somewhere **inside** (\mathcal S); that horizontal step leaves ({c_1,c_2}) immediately, i.e., it enters some column (d\notin{c_1,c_2}) at some row (r\in(r_1,r_2)).

In either case we have a **first** row (r\in(r_1,r_2)) where Turbo’s path steps into a column (d\notin{c_1,c_2}). Put the monster of row (r) in column (d). Then his third attempt hits that monster at that very step and fails.

This placement is legal: (r\neq r_1,r_2) so rows are distinct, and columns (c_1,c_2,d) are distinct, so the “at most one per column” rule is respected. The remaining (2022-3) monsters can be placed injectively in other unused columns, and one column remains empty.

Therefore, **no** strategy can guarantee success in three attempts. Hence (n\ge 4).

## 2) Upper bound: a strategy that always succeeds by the 4th attempt

We describe a strategy that guarantees reaching the last row on or before the 4th attempt.

* **Attempt 1–3:** Pick three *distinct* columns and go straight down each time. (If you reach the last row earlier, you are already done.) In the worst case, each of these three attempts ends upon meeting a monster. Record their (row, column) positions:
  [
  (r_1,c_1),\quad (r_2,c_2),\quad (r_3,c_3),
  ]
  with (2\le r_1<r_2<r_3\le 2023) after reordering by row if necessary. Note that each (c_i) has exactly one monster, namely in row (r_i).

* **Key observation.** In any *known* row (r_i), we know the unique bad cell is ((r_i,c_i)). Hence **every other column is safe in that row**, and Turbo can move horizontally within row (r_i) freely as long as he does not cross ((r_i,c_i)).

* **Fourth attempt (deterministic safe path using only (c_1,c_2,c_3)).**
  Let (L<M<R) be the three columns (c_1,c_2,c_3) arranged left-to-right, and let their monster rows be (r_L,r_M,r_R) (not necessarily ordered the same way). Among the two *extreme* columns ({L,R}), let (E_1) be the one whose monster row is smaller, and (E_2) the other extreme (so (r_{E_1}<r_{E_2})). The remaining column is (M).

  We now build a path that:

  * moves vertically inside a single discovered column through stretches where that column has no monster;
  * changes columns only **inside known rows**, and only between columns that lie on the **same side** of the known row’s monster column so that the horizontal motion never has to cross the bad cell.

  Proceed as follows.

  1. **Start column.** If the earliest monster row among ({r_L,r_M,r_R}) belongs to the middle column (M), then start in (E_2). Otherwise, start in (M). In either case you are **not** in the column whose monster appears first, so the descent to the first switch will be safe.

  2. **First switch at row (r_{E_1}).** Descend to row (r_{E_1}). At this row the monster is in the **extreme** column (E_1). The other two columns are (M) and (E_2), and they lie on the same side of (E_1) (both to its left or both to its right). Ensure you are in (E_2) at this row: if you started in (M), move horizontally within row (r_{E_1}) from (M) to (E_2); if you already started in (E_2), do nothing.

     This horizontal move is safe: in row (r_{E_1}) the only forbidden cell is ((r_{E_1},E_1)), and the segment between (M) and (E_2) does not cross it.

  3. **Second switch at row (r_{E_2}).** Go straight down in (E_2) to its monster row (r_{E_2}). There, the monster is in (E_2), so the other two columns (M,E_1) lie on the same side of (E_2). Among ({M,E_1}), choose the one whose monster row is **not below** (r_{E_2}) (at least (E_1) satisfies this, since (r_{E_1}<r_{E_2})). Move horizontally within row (r_{E_2}) to that column.

  4. **Finish.** From there, continue straight down to the last row. This is safe because we have already passed that column’s unique monster row.

  We changed columns only inside known rows (r_{E_1}) and (r_{E_2}), and never crossed a bad cell; and we only moved vertically in columns on stretches where those columns have no monster. Hence the 4th attempt necessarily reaches the last row.

Thus (n\le 4).

Combining the two parts, the minimal (n) such that Turbo can **always** guarantee reaching the last row on or before the (n)-th attempt is
[
\boxed{4}.
