Let $R=2024$ be the number of rows and $C=2023$ be the number of columns. There are $R-2=2022$ monsters. The constraints imply that there is exactly one monster in each row from 2 to $R-1$, and exactly one column, called the safe column, contains no monsters.

We want to determine the minimum number of attempts $n$ that guarantees Turbo reaches the last row. We will show that $n=3$.

We first analyze the condition under which Turbo can guarantee success. Let $K$ be the set of known monster locations. A cell is "known safe" if it cannot contain a monster in any configuration consistent with $K$. Turbo can guarantee success if and only if there is a path of known safe cells from the first row (R1) to the last row (R$R$).

Let $R_K$ and $C_K$ be the sets of rows and columns where monsters are known. Let $R_U$ and $C_U$ be the sets of unknown rows and columns. $|K|=|R_K|=|C_K|$.
The known safe cells in an intermediate row $r$ ($S_r$) are:
1. If $r \in R_K$, $S_r = C \setminus \{M(r)\}$, where $M(r)$ is the column of the monster in row $r$.
2. If $r \in R_U$, $S_r = C_K$. (Cells in $R_U \times C_U$ are not known safe).

We analyze the connectivity of the graph of known safe cells, $G_S(K)$, by checking connections between adjacent rows $r$ and $r+1$.

Case 1: $r, r+1 \in R_U$. Connection exists if $C_K \ne \emptyset$, i.e., $|K| \ge 1$.
Case 2: $r \in R_K, r+1 \in R_U$ (or vice versa). Connection exists if there is a column $c \in C_K$ such that $c \ne M(r)$. Since $M(r) \in C_K$, this requires $|C_K| \ge 2$, i.e., $|K| \ge 2$.
Case 3: $r, r+1 \in R_K$. Connection exists if there is a column $c$ such that $c \ne M(r)$ and $c \ne M(r+1)$. This requires $C \ge 3$.

Since $C=2023 \ge 3$, the connectivity of $G_S(K)$ is guaranteed if $|K| \ge 2$. (Connectivity to R1 and R$R$ is also guaranteed if $|K| \ge 1$).

Part 1: Lower bound $n \ge 3$.
We use an adversary argument to show that Turbo cannot guarantee success in 2 attempts.

Attempt 1: Turbo chooses a path $P_1$. The adversary identifies the first cell $(r_1, c_1)$ in $P_1$ that is in an intermediate row (rows 2 to $R-1$). The adversary places a monster at $(r_1, c_1)$. This is a valid move.
Attempt 1 fails. $K_1=\{(r_1, c_1)\}$. $|K_1|=1$.

Now we check the connectivity of $G_S(K_1)$. We have $|K_1|=1$.
$R_K=\{r_1\}, C_K=\{c_1\}$.
Since $R-2=2022 \ge 2$, there is at least one row adjacent to $r_1$ that is in $R_U$. Let $r_2$ be such a row (e.g., $r_1+1$ if $r_1 < R-1$).
We analyze the connection between $r_1 \in R_K$ and $r_2 \in R_U$. This falls under Case 2.
The connection requires a column $c \in C_K \setminus \{M(r_1)\}$.
$C_K=\{c_1\}$ and $M(r_1)=c_1$. The required set is empty.
Thus, there is no connection between the safe cells in row $r_1$ and row $r_2$.
$G_S(K_1)$ is disconnected. For example, if $r_1=2$, R1 is connected to the safe cells in R2, but these are disconnected from the safe cells in R3, which are connected to R$R$.

Since there is no guaranteed safe path, Turbo cannot guarantee success in Attempt 2. Therefore, $n \ge 3$.

Part 2: Upper bound $n \le 3$.
We provide a strategy that guarantees success in at most 3 attempts.

Attempt 1: Turbo attempts to go straight down column 1. If it succeeds, the game ends. If it fails, he finds a monster $M_1=(r_1, 1)$.

Attempt 2: Turbo attempts to go straight down column 2. If it succeeds, the game ends. If it fails, he finds a monster $M_2=(r_2, 2)$.

In the worst case, both attempts fail. The knowledge is $K_2=\{(r_1, 1), (r_2, 2)\}$.
Since monsters must be in distinct rows, $r_1 \ne r_2$.
We have $|K_2|=2$.
Since $C=2023 \ge 3$ and $|K_2|=2$, our connectivity analysis shows that $G_S(K_2)$ is connected and provides a path from R1 to R$R$.

Attempt 3: Turbo follows a known safe path in $G_S(K_2)$. This attempt is guaranteed to succeed.

Thus, $n \le 3$.

Combining the lower and upper bounds, the minimum value of $n$ is 3.
