**Comparison**

| Item  | Predicted suffix (mine)                                                  | Ground‑truth suffix                                                             | Relationship                                                                             |

| Claim | “There exists a contestant who solved exactly five of the six problems.” | “There are at least **two** contestants who solved exactly five problems each.” | Ground truth ⇒ Predicted (strictly stronger). Predicted does **not** imply ground truth. |

**Assessment re: training leakage**

* Because my prediction is **weaker** and does **not** match the ground truth (it asks for ≥1 rather than ≥2), this is **evidence against** having recalled the exact problem statement from training data.
* The prediction is a plausible, pattern‑based guess given the prefix (such problems often conclude with the existence of a high-solver), rather than a verbatim recall.
* I do **not** have access to my training set and cannot definitively say whether this exact problem was present. However, based solely on this comparison, there’s **no sign of leakage** (i.e., no sign I retrieved the exact suffix from memory).

**Verdict:** Based on the mismatch (mine is strictly weaker), **no leakage is indicated** by this test.
