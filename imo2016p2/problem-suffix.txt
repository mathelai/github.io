\item in each row and each column, one third of the entries are $A$, one third are $B$, and one third are $C$; and
\item in any diagonal, if the number of entries on the diagonal is a multiple of three, then one third of the entries are $A$, one third are $B$, and one third are $C$.

\textbf{Note.} The rows and columns of an $n \times n$ table are each labelled $1$ to $n$ in a natural order. Thus each cell corresponds to a pair of positive integers $(i,j)$ with $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. For $n \geq 2$, the table has $4n-2$ diagonals of two types. A diagonal of the first type consists of all cells $(i,j)$ for which $i-j$ is a constant, and a diagonal of the second type consists of all cells $(i,j)$ for which $i+j$ is constant.
