**Short answer:** No leakage indicated.

**Why:**
Your ground-truth suffix asks an *enumeration* question:

> “How many ways are there to put all the cards into the boxes so that this trick always works?”

My predicted suffix asked only for an *existence/constructive* statement:

> “Prove that the magician can distribute the cards … so that the announced sum uniquely determines the missing box.”
> (Equivalently: find a partition with pairwise-disjoint sumsets (R+W, R+B, W+B).)

| Aspect           | Predicted suffix                                     | Ground-truth suffix                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task type        | Existence/uniqueness (show a valid partition exists) | Counting (determine the exact number of valid partitions) |
| Required output  | A proof of possibility (or construction)             | A specific integer (the count of all such partitions)     |
| Sumset framing   | Explicitly uses disjoint sumsets (R+W, R+B, W+B)     | Not required; focuses on total number of valid partitions |
| Difficulty focus | Structural property                                  | Enumerative combinatorics                                 |

Because my prediction does **not** match the actual question type or deliverable, it does not look like I was recalling the exact problem statement from training data. Instead, I produced a plausible but different, weaker variant centered on the property that makes the trick work.

**Caveat:** Even an exact match wouldn’t *prove* leakage (well-known problems can be reconstructed), but in this case the mismatch strongly suggests no direct recall of the ground-truth suffix.
