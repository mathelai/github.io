**Answer: (\boxed{12})**

### Reformulation

Let the three (nonempty) boxes be (A,B,C\subset{1,2,\dots,100}) forming a partition.
For two boxes (X,Y), write
[
X+Y:={x+y:;x\in X,;y\in Y}.
]
The trick “always works” iff the audience’s announced sum determines **which** pair of boxes was used, hence **which** box was *not* used. Equivalently,
[
(A+B),\ (A+C),\ (B+C)\quad\text{are pairwise disjoint.}
\tag{*}
]

We will count all partitions (A\sqcup B \sqcup C={1,\dots,100}) with ((*)).

### A basic sumset inequality (with equality case)

> **Lemma.** For finite nonempty (X,Y\subset\mathbb Z),
> [
> |X+Y|\ \ge\ |X|+|Y|-1.
> ]
> Moreover, equality holds iff (X) and (Y) are arithmetic progressions with the **same** common difference.

*Proof (sketch).* List (X={x_1<\cdots<x_m}), (Y={y_1<\cdots<y_n}).
Consider the “staircase” sequence
[
s_1=x_1+y_1,\quad s_2=\min(x_2+y_1,\ x_1+y_2),\ \dots,\ s_{m+n-1}=x_m+y_n,
]
always stepping one index to the right or down by choosing the smaller next sum. One checks (s_1<s_2<\cdots<s_{m+n-1}\in X+Y), giving (|X+Y|\ge m+n-1).

If equality holds, then *only* these (m+n-1) sums occur. In any (2\times2) block
[
\begin{matrix}
x_i+y_j & x_i+y_{j+1}\
x_{i+1}+y_j & x_{i+1}+y_{j+1}
\end{matrix}
]
the two middle sums must be equal (else they would give two distinct values strictly between the corners, creating at least (m+n) distinct sums). Thus
[
x_{i+1}-x_i ;=; y_{j+1}-y_j
]
for all admissible (i,j); hence the consecutive gaps in (X) are all equal to those in (Y), so both are arithmetic progressions with a common difference (d). ∎

---

### Step 1: The sumsets must *partition* ({3,4,\dots,199})

Because ((A+B), (A+C), (B+C)) are disjoint and all sums lie in ({3,\dots,199}) (there are (197) integers there),
[
|(A+B)\cup(A+C)\cup(B+C)| \le 197.
]
On the other hand, by the lemma,
[
|A+B|+|A+C|+|B+C|
;\ge;
(|A|+|B|-1)+(|A|+|C|-1)+(|B|+|C|-1)
=2\cdot 100-3=197.
]
Hence equality holds everywhere. In particular,

* each of (A+B,\ A+C,\ B+C) has cardinality (|\cdot|+|\cdot|-1) and hence (by the lemma) each pair consists of arithmetic progressions with the **same** common difference; and
* the three sets (A+B,\ A+C,\ B+C) are disjoint and together cover **all** sums ({3,4,\dots,199}).

Since every box appears in two pairs, **all three boxes (A,B,C) must be arithmetic progressions with one common difference (d).**

---

### Step 2: Determining the possible common difference (d)

Because the three arithmetic progressions partition ({1,\dots,100}), the common difference (d) cannot exceed (3):

* If (d\ge 4), each box contains numbers in a single residue class modulo (d), so with three boxes we cover at most (3) residue classes—but ({1,\dots,100}) contains **at least 4** residue classes modulo (d). Impossible.

Thus (d\in{1,2,3}). We handle each.

---

#### Case (d=3)

Each box is a progression of step (3), hence consists of numbers congruent to a fixed residue modulo (3). Since there are three nonempty boxes covering all of ({1,\dots,100}), **each box must be exactly one residue class modulo (3)**:
[
{1,4,7,\dots,100},\quad {2,5,8,\dots,98},\quad {3,6,9,\dots,99},
]
in some order.

For such a placement, sums from two boxes have residues
[
(a+b)\bmod 3,\ (a+c)\bmod 3,\ (b+c)\bmod 3,
]
which are pairwise distinct when (a,b,c) are distinct residues. Hence (A+B,\ A+C,\ B+C) lie in **three different residue classes mod (3)** and are therefore disjoint; indeed they partition ({3,4,\dots,199}).

There are (3!,=,6) ways to assign these three residue classes to the labeled boxes (red/white/blue).

---

#### Case (d=2) — impossible

An arithmetic progression of step (2) has fixed parity. Thus either:

* one box contains all even numbers and the other two split the odd numbers, or
* one box contains all odds and the other two split the evens.

In either scenario, consider the two pairs that mix opposite parities. For example, if (O) is the (entire) odd box and (E_1,E_2) split the evens with (\max E_1=2t), (\min E_2=2t+2), then
[
O+E_1={3,5,\dots,2t+99},\qquad O+E_2={2t+3,2t+5,\dots,199},
]
which **overlap** (since (2t+3\le 2t+99)). Thus the sumsets cannot be disjoint. Hence (d=2) is impossible.

---

#### Case (d=1)

Now each box is an interval of consecutive integers. Up to relabeling along the number line, write
[
A={1,2,\dots,r},\quad B={r+1,\dots,w},\quad C={w+1,\dots,100},
]
with (1\le r<w\le 99) (all boxes nonempty). Then
[
\begin{aligned}
A+B &= [r+2,\ r+w],\
A+C &= [w+2,\ r+100],\
B+C &= [r+w+2,\ w+100],
\end{aligned}
]
each a full interval of integers. Disjointness forces:

* (A+B) disjoint from (A+C): (r+w < w+2), i.e. (r<2), hence (r=1).
* (A+C) disjoint from (B+C): (r+100 < r+w+2), i.e. (100 < w+2), hence (w\ge 99). Since (w\le 99), we get (w=99).

Thus the only possibility (up to box labels along the line) is
[
{1},\quad {2,3,\dots,99},\quad {100}.
]
It is easy to check this works: the three sumsets are ([3,100]), ({101}), and ([102,199]), which are disjoint. There are again (3!,=,6) ways to assign these three intervals to the labeled boxes.

### Conclusion and count

Exactly two families occur:

1. **Mod 3 classes** (common difference (3)): the three residue classes modulo (3) in any order — (6) ways.
2. **End-singletons** (common difference (1)): ({1}), ({2,\dots,99}), ({100}) in any order — (6) ways.

Hence the total number of valid placements is
[
6+6=\boxed{12}.
