"comment": "Closest in approach to the shortlist’s block‑count/“rightmost block only” analysis (ruling out unsorted cycles) . The proof correctly pins down the range via the 2‑cycle obstruction for necessity and excludes cycles for sufficiency, but one step (“two consecutive same‑color moves are impossible on a cycle”) is asserted without the standard invariant justification; adding the usual ‘number of blocks cannot increase, so internal moves strictly decrease it; hence on a cycle only the last block can be moved’ fixes the gap, aligning it fully with the official method .",

"comment": "Matches the shortlist solution closely: defines the block count N(C), analyzes fixed points and cycles, shows that on any cycle only the last block can be moved, and derives the sharp bound n ≤ k ≤ n+⌈n/2⌉ = ⌊(3n+1)/2⌋; argument is complete and fully consistent with the official approach .",
