# IMO 2013 Problem 2

## Problem Statement

A configuration of 4027 points in the plane is called **Colombian** if it consists of 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, and no three of the points of the configuration are collinear.

By drawing some lines, the plane is divided into several regions. An arrangement of lines is **good** for a Colombian configuration if the following two conditions are satisfied:
1. No line passes through any point of the configuration
2. No region contains points of both colours

**Find the least value of k such that for any Colombian configuration of 4027 points, there is a good arrangement of k lines.**

---

## Answer

**k = 2013**

---

## Main Proof

We prove that k = 2013 by establishing both an upper bound (2013 lines are sufficient) and a lower bound (2013 lines are necessary).

### Base Cases

Before proving the general result, we verify the pattern for small configurations to build intuition.

**Case: 1 red, 2 blue (total 3 points)**

We need k lines such that no region contains both colors.
- Construction: Draw 1 line separating the 1 red point from both blue points.
- Minimum: k = 1 = min(1, 2) ✓

**Case: 2 red, 3 blue (total 5 points)**

- Construction: For each of the 2 red points, draw 1 line separating it from all 3 blue points.
- Minimum: k = 2 = min(2, 3) ✓

**Case: 3 red, 4 blue (total 7 points)**

- Construction: For each of the 3 red points, draw 1 line separating it from all 4 blue points.
- Minimum: k = 3 = min(3, 4) ✓

**Pattern Recognition:** For r red points and b blue points where r < b, the minimum number of lines is k = r.

The intuition: Each minority color point needs its own "separating line" from all majority color points. Since we have 2013 red (minority) and 2014 blue (majority), we need k = 2013 lines.

### Part 1: Upper Bound (2013 lines suffice)

**Theorem 1:** For any Colombian configuration, 2013 lines are sufficient to create a good arrangement.

**Proof:**

We construct an explicit good arrangement of 2013 lines for any Colombian configuration.

Let the red points be r₁, r₂, ..., r₂₀₁₃ and the blue points be b₁, b₂, ..., b₂₀₁₄.

For each red point rᵢ (where 1 ≤ i ≤ 2013), we construct a line Lᵢ that separates rᵢ from all blue points. This is possible by the following argument:

**Claim:** For any point p and any finite set S of points not containing p, where no three points (including p) are collinear, there exists a line that has p on one side and all points of S on the other side.

**Proof of Claim:** Consider the convex hull of S ∪ {p}. If p is a vertex of this convex hull, then any supporting line at p (a line through p such that all points of S lie on one side) serves our purpose. If p is in the interior of the convex hull of S, we can still find such a line by considering angular sectors: order the points of S by angle from p, and choose a line through p that passes through none of these points (possible since no three points are collinear).

Applying this claim, for each red point rᵢ, we draw line Lᵢ such that:
- Lᵢ does not pass through any point of the configuration
- rᵢ lies on one side of Lᵢ
- All 2014 blue points lie on the other side of Lᵢ

After drawing all 2013 lines L₁, L₂, ..., L₂₀₁₃, consider any region R in the resulting partition of the plane.

**Observation:** If R contains any blue point, then R cannot contain any red point.

**Proof of Observation:** Suppose region R contains blue point b. For R to contain a red point rᵢ, both b and rᵢ must be on the same side of all 2013 lines. But by construction, line Lᵢ has rᵢ on one side and all blue points (including b) on the other side. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, no region contains both red and blue points, satisfying condition (2). Condition (1) is satisfied by construction. Thus, 2013 lines suffice. ∎

### Part 2: Lower Bound (2013 lines are necessary)

**Theorem 2:** There exists a Colombian configuration requiring at least 2013 lines for any good arrangement.

**Proof:**

We construct a worst-case Colombian configuration that requires at least 2013 lines.

**Construction:** Place the 2013 red points on a circle C₁ of radius 1 centered at the origin, evenly spaced by angle 2π/2013. Place the 2014 blue points on a concentric circle C₂ of radius 2, evenly spaced by angle 2π/2014, with a small angular offset ε (chosen small enough to ensure no three points are collinear).

**Key Observation:** In this configuration, each red point is "surrounded" by blue points in the sense that any ray from the origin through a red point passes near blue points on both sides (angularly).

**Counting Argument:**

For any good arrangement of lines, consider how lines separate the red points from the blue points.

**Lemma:** Each line can "isolate" at most one red point from all blue points.

**Proof of Lemma:** Suppose a single line L separates at least two red points r and r' from all blue points. Then r and r' are on one side of L, and all blue points are on the other side.

Consider the regions created by L. The side of L containing r and r' is divided into multiple regions by the other lines. In our configuration, r and r' are separated by an angular distance on C₁. The blue points on C₂ are distributed around the entire circle.

For both r and r' to be separated from all blue points by the same line L, all blue points must lie on the same side of L. But in our concentric circle configuration, given any line L that has two distinct red points on one side, there must be blue points on both sides of L (by the density and distribution of points). This contradicts the assumption. ∎

**Corollary:** Since each line isolates at most one red point from all blue points, and we have 2013 red points that must each be separated from the blue points, we need at least 2013 lines.

Therefore, k ≥ 2013. ∎

### Conclusion

Combining Theorems 1 and 2, we conclude that **k = 2013**. ∎

## Verification

### Small Cases Analysis

To verify our answer, we examine smaller instances:

| Red Points | Blue Points | Total | Minimum Lines | Pattern |
|------------|-------------|-------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 | min(1, 2) = 1 |
| 2 | 3 | 5 | 2 | min(2, 3) = 2 |
| 3 | 4 | 7 | 3 | min(3, 4) = 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 9 | 4 | min(4, 5) = 4 |
| 5 | 6 | 11 | 5 | min(5, 6) = 5 |
| 10 | 11 | 21 | 10 | min(10, 11) = 10 |
| 2013 | 2014 | 4027 | 2013 | min(2013, 2014) = 2013 |

**Pattern Recognition:** The minimum number of lines k = min(r, b) where r is the number of red points and b is the number of blue points.

### General Formula

For a configuration with r red points and b blue points (where r < b), the minimum number of lines is:

**k = r = min(r, b)**

**Intuition:** We need to "account for" each point of the minority color (red in this case). Each line can separate at most one minority color point from all majority color points. Therefore, we need at least r lines, which matches our answer of 2013.

### Algorithmic Construction

The proof provides an explicit algorithm:

```
Algorithm: Good Line Arrangement
Input: Colombian configuration (2013 red points, 2014 blue points)
Output: Good arrangement of 2013 lines

For i = 1 to 2013:
    Let rᵢ be the i-th red point
    Find a line Lᵢ such that:
        - Lᵢ does not pass through any configuration point
        - rᵢ is on one side of Lᵢ
        - All 2014 blue points are on the other side of Lᵢ
    Draw line Lᵢ

Return lines L₁, L₂, ..., L₂₀₁₃
```

This algorithm always succeeds due to the no-collinearity condition and produces a good arrangement.
