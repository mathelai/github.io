Let n be a positive integer. A Nordic square is an n Ã— n board containing all the integers from 1 to n^{2} so that each cell contains exactly one number. An uphill path is a sequence of one or more cells such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the first cell in the sequence is a valley, meaning the number written is less than all its orthogonal neighbors,
\item each subsequent cell in the sequence is orthogonally adjacent to the previous cell, and
\item the numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.
\end{enumerate}
Find, as a function of n, the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square.
