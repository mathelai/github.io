Let $N=2025$. We are considering an $N \times N$ grid. Matilda places rectangular tiles such that they do not overlap, and the set of uncovered squares $U$ has exactly one square in each row and each column. This means $U$ corresponds to a permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, \dots, N\}$, such that $U = \{(i, \pi(i))\}$. Let $C$ be the set of covered squares. We want to find the minimum number of tiles required to cover $C$. Let $K(\pi)$ be this minimum number for a given permutation $\pi$. We seek to determine $f(N) = \min_\pi K(\pi)$.

We will prove that $f(N) = 2N-2$ for $N \ge 1$.

### Part 1: Upper Bound ($f(N) \le 2N-2$)

We show that there exists a configuration of uncovered squares that can be tiled with $2N-2$ tiles. Consider the identity permutation, $\pi(i)=i$. The uncovered squares are on the main diagonal $U=\{(i,i)\}$.
The covered region $C$ is the union of the region strictly above the diagonal, $C_{upper} = \{(i,j) : i<j\}$, and the region strictly below the diagonal, $C_{lower} = \{(i,j) : i>j\}$.

We can tile $C_{upper}$ with $N-1$ horizontal rectangles:
$T_i = \{i\} \times \{i+1, \dots, N\}$ for $i=1, \dots, N-1$.

We can tile $C_{lower}$ with $N-1$ vertical rectangles:
$S_j = \{j+1, \dots, N\} \times \{j\}$ for $j=1, \dots, N-1$.

The total number of tiles used is $(N-1) + (N-1) = 2N-2$.
Since $f(N)$ is the minimum over all permutations, $f(N) \le K(\text{id}) \le 2N-2$.

### Part 2: Lower Bound ($f(N) \ge 2N-2$)

We prove this by induction on $N$.

**Base cases:**
For $N=1$, the $1\times 1$ grid has 1 uncovered square and requires 0 tiles. $f(1)=0$. $2(1)-2=0$.
For $N=2$, the $2\times 2$ grid has 2 uncovered and 2 covered squares. The two covered squares must not be adjacent, otherwise the uncovered squares would also be adjacent (either in the same row or column), which does not form a permutation. If the covered squares are not adjacent (e.g., $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$), the smallest rectangle containing them also contains the uncovered squares (e.g., $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$). Thus, they must be covered by separate tiles. $f(2)=2$. $2(2)-2=2$.

**Inductive step:** Assume $f(k) \ge 2k-2$ for $1 \le k < N$.

Let $\pi^*$ be a permutation that achieves the minimum $f(N)$, and let $T$ be an optimal tiling for the corresponding uncovered set $U^*$. $|T|=f(N)$.

We can permute the rows and columns without changing the number of tiles needed. Thus, we can assume without loss of generality that the bottom-right square $(N, N)$ is uncovered.

Let $G'$ be the $(N-1) \times (N-1)$ subgrid formed by the first $N-1$ rows and columns. Since $(N,N)$ is uncovered, the other $N-1$ uncovered squares are in $G'$, forming a permutation configuration $U'$ of size $N-1$. Let $C'$ be the covered area in $G'$.

We partition the tiling $T$ into two sets:
1. $T_{int}$: Tiles that intersect $G'$.
2. $T_{ext}$: Tiles that do not intersect $G'$.

**Analysis of $T_{int}$:**
The restrictions of the tiles in $T_{int}$ to $G'$ form a tiling of $C'$. Let this induced tiling be $T_{G'}$. We have $|T_{int}| = |T_{G'}|$.
Since $C'$ is the complement of a permutation of size $N-1$, the number of tiles required to cover it is at least $f(N-1)$.
$|T_{int}| \ge f(N-1)$. By the induction hypothesis, $|T_{int}| \ge 2(N-1)-2 = 2N-4$.

**Analysis of $T_{ext}$:**
The tiles in $T_{ext}$ are contained entirely in the exterior region $E = G \setminus G'$. Since $(N,N)$ is uncovered, the covered part of $E$ consists of the disjoint regions $R_N^{cov} = \{N\} \times \{1,\dots,N-1\}$ and $C_N^{cov} = \{1,\dots,N-1\} \times \{N\}$.

We show that $|T_{ext}| \ge 2$.
Since $U'$ is a permutation of size $N-1$, there is an uncovered square in the last column of $G'$, say $(i_0, N-1) \in U'$, and an uncovered square in the last row of $G'$, say $(N-1, j_0) \in U'$. Here $1 \le i_0, j_0 \le N-1$.

Consider the square $S_C = (i_0, N)$. It is covered by some tile $R_C \in T$.
We claim $R_C \in T_{ext}$. Suppose $R_C$ intersects $G'$. Since $R_C$ is a rectangle containing $(i_0, N)$, if it intersects $G'$, it must extend to column $N-1$ or earlier. In that case, $R_C$ must contain the adjacent square $(i_0, N-1)$. However, $(i_0, N-1)$ is uncovered, which is a contradiction. Thus, $R_C$ must not intersect $G'$, so $R_C \in T_{ext}$. $R_C$ is contained in $C_N^{cov}$.

Similarly, consider the square $S_R = (N, j_0)$. It is covered by some tile $R_R \in T$. If $R_R$ were to intersect $G'$, it must extend to row $N-1$ or earlier. In that case, $R_R$ must contain the adjacent square $(N-1, j_0)$. However, $(N-1, j_0)$ is uncovered, a contradiction. Thus, $R_R \in T_{ext}$. $R_R$ is contained in $R_N^{cov}$.

Since $R_N^{cov}$ and $C_N^{cov}$ are disjoint, $R_C$ and $R_R$ are distinct tiles. Thus, $|T_{ext}| \ge 2$.

**Total number of tiles:**
$f(N) = |T| = |T_{int}| + |T_{ext}| \ge (2N-4) + 2 = 2N-2$.

This completes the induction.

### Conclusion

We have proven that the minimum number of tiles required is $2N-2$.
For $N=2025$, the minimum number of tiles is $2(2025) - 2 = 4050 - 2 = 4048$.
