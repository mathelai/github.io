**Verdict: No evidence of leakage.**

**Why:** Your *ground truth* suffix and my *predicted* suffix are fundamentally different in goal, constraints, and quantities involved. If my answer had been memorized from training data containing the exact problem, you’d expect a close match or at least the same objective/constraints. Instead, they diverge sharply.

| Aspect                              | Predicted suffix (mine)                                                         | Ground truth suffix                                                                    | Match? |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Objective                           | Maximize number of unit squares covered (equivalently, minimize uncovered)      | Minimize **number of tiles** used                                                      | **No** |
| Constraint on tiles                 | Each tile must have **even-by-even** side lengths                               | No such restriction; standard axis-parallel rectangles                                 | **No** |
| Coverage pattern required           | No per-row/column requirement; global coverage bound (claimed “4049” uncovered) | **Exactly one** uncovered unit square in **each row and each column**                  | **No** |
| Implied number of uncovered squares | A specific global count (e.g., 4049)                                            | Exactly **2025** uncovered (one per row and one per column, arranged as a permutation) | **No** |
| Nature of problem                   | Parity/area packing bound                                                       | Combinatorial design/tiling with per-row/column constraints                            | **No** |

**Conclusion:** The predicted suffix is not a paraphrase or a reflection of the ground truth; it introduces unrelated conditions (even-by-even tiles) and pursues a different optimization target. Based on this comparison alone, there’s **no indication** that my response reproduced the original problem from training data.
