**Problem suffix:**
Assume that every tile Matilda uses has **both side lengths even** (so each tile is an even-by-even rectangle). Determine, with proof, the maximum possible number of unit squares she can cover.

*Equivalently, prove that no matter how she places such tiles, at least (4049) unit squares must remain uncovered, and show that there is a placement that leaves exactly (4049) squares uncovered.*
