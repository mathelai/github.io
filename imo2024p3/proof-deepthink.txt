We are asked to prove the following statement:

Let $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers, and let $k$ be a positive integer. Suppose that, for each $i \geq 1$, $a_i$ is equal to the number of times $i$ appears in the list $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$.

Prove that at least one of the sequence $(a_n)$ and $k$ is eventually periodic.

We will show that the premises of this statement lead to a contradiction. Therefore, no such sequence $(a_n)$ and integer $k$ exist, and the statement is vacuously true.

Let us analyze the given conditions.
1. $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of positive integers. This means $a_i \geq 1$ for all $i \geq 1$.
2. $k$ is a positive integer, which means $k$ is finite.
3. For each $i \geq 1$, $a_i$ is the count of the occurrences of $i$ in the finite list $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k)$. Let $C_i$ denote this count. The condition is $a_i = C_i$ for all $i \geq 1$.

Consider the list $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k)$. This list has exactly $k$ elements. We can calculate the total number of elements in the list by summing the counts of all possible values that appear in it. Since the elements $a_j$ are positive integers, we sum the counts $C_i$ over all positive integers $i$:
$$k = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} C_i$$
This equality holds because summing the counts of all distinct values in a list must equal the total number of elements in the list.

By condition (3), we can replace $C_i$ with $a_i$:
$$k = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i$$

Now we use condition (1), which states that $a_i \geq 1$ for all $i \geq 1$. We analyze the infinite sum $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i$.
The partial sums $S_N = \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i$ satisfy:
$$S_N = \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \geq \sum_{i=1}^{N} 1 = N$$
The infinite sum is the limit of the partial sums as $N \to \infty$. Since $S_N \geq N$, the limit diverges to infinity:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i = \infty$$

Combining this result with the identity derived earlier, we obtain:
$$k = \infty$$

However, this contradicts condition (2), which states that $k$ is a positive integer, and thus $k$ must be finite.

Since the premises lead to a contradiction, there cannot exist an infinite sequence of positive integers $(a_n)$ and a positive integer $k$ satisfying the given conditions.

The statement we are asked to prove is an implication of the form "If P, then Q", where P is the supposition that such $(a_n)$ and $k$ exist and satisfy the conditions. Since the premise P is false, the implication is vacuously true.
