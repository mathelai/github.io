This is a solution to the IMO problem.

Let $n$ be the number of line segments, denoted by $L_1, \dots, L_n$. Let $P_{ij}$ be the intersection point of $L_i$ and $L_j$. We are given that every two segments cross and no three segments meet at a point. Each segment has $n-1$ intersection points.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)] Prove that Geoff can never fulfill his wish if $n$ is even.
\end{enumerate}

Let $n=2m$ be even, where $m \ge 1$. The number of intersection points on each segment is $n-1=2m-1$, which is odd. Therefore, for each segment $L_i$, there is a unique middle intersection point, $M_i$. This point is the $m$-th intersection point starting from either endpoint of $L_i$.

Regardless of the starting endpoint chosen by Geoff for the frog on $L_i$, the frog will reach the middle point $M_i$ exactly at time $t=m$.

We will show that there exist two distinct segments $L_i$ and $L_j$ such that their middle points coincide, $M_i=M_j$. If this is the case, the frogs on $L_i$ and $L_j$ will both arrive at this point at time $m$, causing a collision, regardless of Geoff's choices.

To prove this, we use the concept of duality in the projective plane. We extend the segments to lines. The configuration of $n$ lines is dual to a configuration of $n$ points, let $D_i$ be the point dual to the line containing $L_i$. Since no three lines are concurrent, no three points are collinear. The intersection $P_{ij}$ is dual to the line passing through $D_i$ and $D_j$.

The order of intersection points along $L_i$ corresponds to the angular order of the lines passing through $D_i$. The middle point $M_i$ corresponds to the median line passing through $D_i$. Since there are $n-1=2m-1$ (odd) lines through $D_i$, the median line is unique. If $M_i=P_{ij}$, the dual line $D_i D_j$ is the median line for $D_i$.

This median line divides the remaining $n-2=2m-2$ points into two equal halves, with $m-1$ points on each side. Such a line is called a halving line.

The definition of a halving line is symmetric: the line $D_i D_j$ divides the set of remaining points equally. Thus, $D_i D_j$ is a halving line for $D_i$ if and only if it is a halving line for $D_j$.

We define a mapping $\sigma: \{1, \dots, n\} \to \{1, \dots, n\}$ such that $\sigma(i)=j$ if $M_i=P_{ij}$. Since the halving line through $D_i$ is unique, $\sigma$ is well-defined. Also $\sigma(i) \neq i$. Due to the symmetry of the halving property, $\sigma$ is an involution, i.e., $\sigma(\sigma(i))=i$.

Since $\sigma$ is a fixed-point free involution on a set of $n$ elements, it is a product of $n/2$ disjoint transpositions. Since $n \ge 2$, there is at least one transposition $(i, j)$. For this pair, $\sigma(i)=j$ and $\sigma(j)=i$. This means $M_i=P_{ij}$ and $M_j=P_{ji}$. Thus $M_i=M_j$.

A collision is inevitable at this mutual middle point at time $m=n/2$. Therefore, Geoff can never fulfill his wish if $n$ is even.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Prove that Geoff can always fulfill his wish if $n$ is odd.
\end{enumerate}

Let $n$ be odd. We use a strategy based on the parity of the arrival times.
Fix an arbitrary orientation for each segment $L_i$. Let $x_{i,j} \in \{1, \dots, n-1\}$ be the rank of $P_{ij}$ along $L_i$ in this orientation.

Geoff chooses a starting endpoint for each segment, represented by $s_i \in \{0, 1\}$. $s_i=0$ means the frog moves in the chosen orientation, $s_i=1$ means the opposite direction.
The time $T_i(P_{ij})$ when the frog on $L_i$ reaches $P_{ij}$ is:
$T_i(P_{ij}) = (1-s_i)x_{i,j} + s_i(n-x_{i,j}) = x_{i,j} + s_i(n-2x_{i,j})$.

Since $n$ is odd, $n-2x_{i,j}$ is odd. The parity of $T_i(P_{ij})$ is:
$T_i(P_{ij}) \equiv x_{i,j} + s_i \pmod 2$.

If we can find a configuration $s=(s_1, \dots, s_n)$ such that for all $i \neq j$, the arrival times $T_i$ and $T_j$ at $P_{ij}$ have different parities, then $T_i \neq T_j$, and no collision occurs.

We require $T_i(P_{ij}) \not\equiv T_j(P_{ij}) \pmod 2$:
$x_{i,j} + s_i \not\equiv x_{j,i} + s_j \pmod 2$
$s_i + s_j \equiv x_{i,j} + x_{j,i} + 1 \pmod 2$.

Let $R_{ij} = x_{i,j} + x_{j,i} + 1 \pmod 2$. We are looking for a solution to the system of linear equations over GF(2):
$s_i + s_j = R_{ij}$ for all $i \neq j$.

This system has a solution if and only if the sum of $R_{ij}$ over any cycle is even. Let $C$ be a cycle of length $k$. We need $\sum_{C} R_{ij} \equiv 0 \pmod 2$.

$\sum_{C} R_{ij} = \sum_{C} (x_{i,j}+x_{j,i}+1) = S_C + k \pmod 2$,
where $S_C = \sum_{C} (x_{i,j}+x_{j,i})$ is the sum of the ranks over the cycle.

The consistency condition is $S_C \equiv k \pmod 2$.

This relies on the following known result in combinatorial geometry:

**Lemma.** For any arrangement of lines (or pseudolines) where every pair intersects, and for any cycle $C$ of length $k$, the sum of the ranks $S_C$ (defined with respect to arbitrary orientations) satisfies $S_C \equiv k \pmod 2$.

We first note that the parity of $S_C$ is independent of the chosen orientations. If we flip the orientation of a line involved in the cycle, the sum $S_C$ changes by an even amount ($2n$ minus twice the sum of the involved ranks). The proof of the lemma itself requires techniques from the theory of arrangements, such as analyzing the invariance under mutations or using a specific orientation (e.g., based on slopes) and analyzing the combinatorial structure.

Assuming this Lemma, the system of equations is consistent and always has a solution $s^*$.
For this configuration $s^*$, the arrival times $T_i, T_j$ at $P_{ij}$ satisfy:
$T_i+T_j \equiv (x_{i,j}+s^*_i) + (x_{j,i}+s^*_j) = (x_{i,j}+x_{j,i}) + R_{ij}$
$= (x_{i,j}+x_{j,i}) + (x_{i,j}+x_{j,i}+1) \equiv 1 \pmod 2$.
The arrival times have different parities, so no collision occurs.
Therefore, Geoff can always fulfill his wish if $n$ is odd.
