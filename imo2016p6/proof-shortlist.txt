Let $n \geqslant 2$ be an integer. In the plane, there are $n$ segments given in such a way that any two segments have an intersection point in the interior, and no three segments intersect at a single point. Jeff places a snail at one of the endpoints of each of the segments and claps his hands $n-1$ times. Each time when he claps his hands, all the snails move along their own segments and stay at the next intersection points until the next clap. Since there are $n-1$ intersection points on each segment, all snails will reach the furthest intersection points from their starting points after $n-1$ claps.\\
(a) Prove that if $n$ is odd then Jeff can always place the snails so that no two of them ever occupy the same intersection point.\\
(b) Prove that if $n$ is even then there must be a moment when some two snails occupy the same intersection point no matter how Jeff places the snails.

Solution. We consider a big disk which contains all the segments. We extend each segment to a line $l_{i}$ so that each of them cuts the disk at two distinct points $A_{i}, B_{i}$.\\
(a) For odd $n$, we travel along the circumference of the disk and mark each of the points $A_{i}$ or $B_{i}$ 'in' and 'out' alternately. Since every pair of lines intersect in the disk, there are exactly $n-1$ points between $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ for any fixed $1 \leqslant i \leqslant n$. As $n$ is odd, this means one of $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ is marked 'in' and the other is marked 'out'. Then Jeff can put a snail on the endpoint of each segment which is closer to the 'in' side of the corresponding line. We claim that the snails on $l_{i}$ and $l_{j}$ do not meet for any pairs $i, j$, hence proving part (a).\\

Without loss of generality, we may assume the snails start at $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ respectively. Let $l_{i}$ intersect $l_{j}$ at $P$. Note that there is an odd number of points between arc $A_{i} A_{j}$. Each of these points belongs to a line $l_{k}$. Such a line $l_{k}$ must intersect exactly one of\\
the segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$, making an odd number of intersections. For the other lines, they may intersect both segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$, or meet none of them. Therefore, the total number of intersection points on segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$ (not counting $P$ ) is odd. However, if the snails arrive at $P$ at the same time, then there should be the same number of intersections on $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$, which gives an even number of intersections. This is a contradiction so the snails do not meet each other.\\
(b) For even $n$, we consider any way that Jeff places the snails and mark each of the points $A_{i}$ or $B_{i}$ 'in' and 'out' according to the directions travelled by the snails. In this case there must be two neighbouring points $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ both of which are marked 'in'. Let $P$ be the intersection of the segments $A_{i} B_{i}$ and $A_{j} B_{j}$. Then any other segment meeting one of the segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$ must also meet the other one, and so the number of intersections on $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$ are the same. This shows the snails starting from $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ will meet at $P$.

Comment. The conclusions do not hold for pseudosegments, as can be seen from the following examples.
